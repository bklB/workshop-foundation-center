Host to more than 500,000 visitors a year, the Huntington comprises a library, art galleries, and botanical gardens on a two-hundred-acre spread in San Marino, California. During their lifetimes, Huntington and his wife amassed a vast collection of art, rare books, and manuscripts, which are now displayed in several buildings on the property, including the Huntington Art Gallery that occupies the Beaux Arts mansion where the couple lived. In the early 1900s, Huntington and his superintendent William Hertrich began to display rare and exotic plants from all over the world on the property; these became the basis for the Huntington Botanical Gardens.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nThe Huntington Library contains more than six million rare books, manuscripts, prints, photographs, maps, and other materials in the fields of British and American history and literature, only a portion of which are displayed at any time in the Main Exhibition and West halls. The Huntington Art Collections are housed in two buildings: the Huntington Art Gallery  which includes a distinguished collection of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British art and the Arabella D. Huntington Memorial Art Collection of Renaissance paintings and sculpture as well as eighteenth-century French sculpture, tapestries, porcelain, and furniture  and the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art, which include works from 1690 to the 1950s. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, which cover a hundred and twenty acres, include more than fourteen thousand different varieties of plants in more than a dozen garden areas. The Huntington also provides resources to scholars using its collections for research, offers fellowships, and provides a variety of educational programs.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe Huntington Web site features a number of educational platforms, including Explorations in American History and the Land of Golden Dreams, a presentation of rare Gold Rush materials; a virtual tour of the Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for Botanical Science; and the interactive ArtWonders site. Visitors to the site also can find information about current, upcoming, and permanent exhibitions; keep up abreast of events via the organization's blogs; browse, save, and share items in the Huntington Art Collections Online Catalogue; become a member; and connect to the organization on various social networking and media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and iTunes.\n\n\nFunding:\nThe Huntington receives support from foundations, corporations, and individuals.",

        "content":"Never before has more been asked of State Education Agencies (SEAs), commonly known as state departments of education. In recent years, policymakers at the state and federal level have viewed the SEA as the default entity for implementing new and sweeping K -- 12 initiatives -- everything from Race to the Top grants and ESEA waivers to teacher evaluation reform and digital learning. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But SEAs were designed -- and evolved over decades -- to address a relatively narrow set of tasks: distributing state and federal dollars, monitoring the use of these funds, and overseeing the implementation of federal and state education programs. They were not created -- nor have they developed the core competencies -- to drive crucial reforms. Accordingly, we argue that despite the best efforts of talented, energetic leaders, SEAs will never be able to deliver the reform results we need. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  But there is an alternative. We should view the SEA through the lens of Reinventing Government &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; (1993), the path-breaking book by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler. In short, Osborne and Gaebler call for state agencies to &quot;steer&quot; more and &quot;row&quot; less. Here, we call for federal and state leaders to apply their thesis to SEAs, scaling back the tasks SEAs perform and empowering nongovernmental organizations to take up the slack. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; We offer the &quot;4Cs&quot; model (control, contract, cleave, and create) for rethinking state-level K -- 12 reform work. In practice, this means pursuing activities on two parallel tracks. On one, we should make the SEA a far leaner organization, able to execute a narrow set of activities. On the other, we should foster the growth of a new state-level reform ecosystem composed of a range of entities -- primarily independent public entities or nonprofits -- able to carry out key reforms.",

That report found that the Philadelphia region had one of the nation's most diverse economies, low unemployment, a low poverty rate, affordable housing, relatively low taxes, short commute times, and a multitude of colleges, universities, and hospitals. This 2007 version of Rating the Region updates the 1993 report, providing an objective, quantifiable analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Delaware Valley region. Using comparable data from the Census Bureau and other Federal agencies, existing conditions and trends of the region are measured against other metropolitan regions around the country.&lt;br /&gt; The report compares the metropolitan areas in terms of their human environment (including diversity, age, income, education, health, and safety); the economy; the built and natural environment (including density, housing characteristics, residential construction, and urban parkland); transportation; and the civic environment (including representation, taxes, revenue, expenditures, conservation funding, and arts and culture). Based on this analysis, the Delaware Valley continues to offer a diverse economy, affordable housing opportunities, a quality highway and transit network, short commute times, quality air and port facilities, a large number of colleges, universities, and cultural opportunities, and an extensive health care network. These strengths, however, threaten to be checked by regional challenges, such as urban concentrations of poverty and unemployment, low labor force participation, poor educational attainment in its cities, a rapidly aging population, and fragmented local government. The challenge facing the region is capitalizing and building on its strengths while recognizing and working to address its identified weaknesses.",

        "content":"Why has email become such a critical channel of communication for nonprofits? Today's donor is more comfortable online and needs information now  they read email before snail mail; they expect personalized information that's immediate and available to them on their own schedule. Organizations that interact with each constituent in terms that are relevant to him or her find it easier to cultivate affinity and support. With email, organizations can send more relevant information more frequently, thanks to the channel's cost effectiveness and measurability.\n\nIs your organization using email as effectively as you'd like? The average organization is experiencing around a 4 percent conversion rate on calls to action, raising 5 percent of total funds online, growing the email subscriber list at 17 percent each year, and retaining at least 81 percent of those subscribers. If your organization is falling short on these metrics, you may need to revisit your strategic plan to identify areas where you can improve. To begin:\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about your audience. Who are you writing to? Are you breaking your audience into segments? Do you have their permission to contact them?\n\n\n\nThink about what you want to say. What does each audience segment need to hear from you? How is email enhancing your multi-channel (online, offline, in person) marketing strategy? Are you using a healthy mix of messages (balancing asks with acknowledgements and news)?\n\n\n\nThink about when they should hear from you. When do you need to reach out? How often should you reach out? Are you giving people enough time to take action? Are you following up quickly enough when you have something positive (or negative) to share?\n\n\n\n\n\nYour strategy should be driven by an understanding of what are you trying to accomplish, long term. Is your organization more focused on acquiring new constituents or on cultivating more support out of former supporters? Many organizations answer, \"Both.\" But even if you'd like to accomplish both, you are probably guided by one more than the other. Consider this: Which does your boss ask you about first  how many email addresses have been added to your list this week? Or, how much more did your organization raise online this month versus the same period last month? The first question is driven by an acquisition strategy, the second by a cultivation strategy.\n\nIf acquisition is your strategy, you need to send email messages frequently on a wide variety of subjects, making your \"Forward to a Friend\" request highly visible. You should use more of an e-newsletter format, with multiple calls to action, raising your chances that a contact you don't know very well (yet) will find something compelling to react to.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are more interested in increasing year-over-year donations through your e-marketing efforts, then you are driven by a cultivation strategy. This type of organization needs to spend more time on segmentation and on building a logical flow of communication that responds to the needs of each segment. The surest way to get someone to give again is to give them information on what their gift accomplished and to ask them for future support that builds on the first gift.\n\nEither way, a well crafted message will ensure the highest click-through and conversion rates. To make sure your messages are as powerful as they can be, think back to your Marketing 101 class and the \"4 Ps\": Product, Place, Price, and Promotion. These basic principles can be just as effective at helping you craft compelling messages as they are at selling toothpaste. In short, your messages should clearly convey:\n\n\n\n\n\nA clear description of your \"product.\" What does your audience get back when they respond to you? What is given in exchange for support? If the \"product\" is the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from knowing you are doing something great for the community, make sure that is articulated fully. Sell that philanthropic rush to your audience.\n\n\n\nAn obvious \"place\" to take action. Where/how does you organization let people participate? If you are advertising an event through email, the ability to register should be one click away and fully enabled online. You will lose a large number of potential participants if you make them switch to offline response methods (like a fax-back or call-in).\n\n\n\nThe \"price\" of participation. State clearly what you want people to do. Create value. How does supporting your organization differ from supporting another cause? Or from spending money or time another way?\n\n\n\nAn explanation of the \"promotion.\" Why should the audience respond now? What is at stake  for the audience, not just the organization  if they do not respond to your request today?\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the content is in order, it becomes critical to focus on the design of the message. Online messages may be intended to convey the same information as traditional marketing pieces, but they must be tailored to the medium of delivery. Your tone should be more conversational online. You can also improve the odds of being read by adopting these stylistic elements:\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep content short and to the point.\n\n\n\nUse bulleted lists for improved scan-ability.\n\n\n\nUse stories and first-hand accounts with photos to engage readers.\n\n\n\nKeep paragraphs short: 1-2 sentences, not 4-5.\n\n\n\nUse statistics, testimonials, case studies, and expert opinions to support your point and call them out graphically to break up blocks of text.\n\n\n\nUse specific, action-oriented language to give readers a sense of excitement and urgency.\n\n\n\nRepeat the call to action several places in the email, graphically, in navigation, and in line with body copy.\n\n\n\nIf you have more to say, use a landing page. Use the email message to provide highlights/teasers with links to the full article or a page where readers can learn more. This is an especially useful technique because the landing page can be updated on the fly if readers are clicking (but not taking further action).\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout, take advantage of the most exciting benefit email offers your organization  real-time results. Monitor your deliverability, click-through, and conversion rates. Take note of the growth and retention of your subscription list. Keep an eye on visit duration. And remember: Online communication allows you to communicate more effectively with a larger audience than any other medium because of the ability it gives you to review these metrics and respond nimbly to problems they may highlight or further optimize whatever is working. Good luck!\n\nThe senior product marketing manager at Blackbaud describes how to use email strategically to improve your organization's fundraising results....",

We focus particularly on the biomedical sciences. The contextual explanation that women are under-represented in the types of positions from which faculty typically launch entrepreneurial activity is the most obvious. But the data suggest that for the biomedical sciences context is not sufficient in explaining the entrepreneurial gap. We look elsewhere to factors affecting supply and factors affecting demand. The former include gender differences in attitudes towards risk, competition, &quot;selling&quot; of science, type of research and geographic location. The latter include the role of networks, preferences of venture capitalists and &quot;gender discounting.&quot; We explore the associated hypotheses.

        "title":"Ukraine: Foundations, the Crisis, and the Future",
        "content":"Since the explosion of popular protest in Maidan Square, Ukraine has been riven by civil and political strife whose character and shape is often difficult to discern as is its eventual outcome. In this supercharged atmosphere of political protest and martial posturing, what have foundations been doing to help those caught up in events or struggling to reshape their country?\n\nPerhaps the first thing to say is that the situation in Ukraine is an extraordinarily fluid one. Even while this article was being researched and written, things have changed: the country has a new government. While at the state level some of the tension has gone out of the situation, fighting still continues in the east of the country between government forces and pro-Russian militias, with reports of people fleeing the rebel capital of Sloviansk amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. The UK's Guardian newspaper reported on June 12 that most residents of Sloviansk had been without water, electricity, and gas for the previous week.\n\nTwo foundations active in Ukraine at the onset of the crisis were the ERSTE Foundation, based in Austria and working throughout Central and Eastern Europe, and the Open Society Foundations' International Renaissance Foundation, based in Ukraine itself. Both have found themselves drawn into events to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nFeet Already On the Ground: ERSTE Foundation\n\nThe ERSTE Foundation has an education program involving youth between the ages of 12 and 17 in four Ukrainian cities (the project is also running in eleven other countries in the region), and supports the Visual Cultural Research Center, an arts project in Kiev primarily intended as an exhibition space. Its target group varies from project to project. As Robin Gosejohann, project manager Europe at ERSTE Foundation, explains, \"We work with local partner organizations who are active or want to become active in civil society in their area/community.\"\n\nWhat has been the foundation's response to the crisis? Most of the countries in which it works have political issues. \"We try to react to those,\" says Gosejohann, \"not by reshaping or redrafting entire projects...[but by] building on the projects that already exist.\" As an example, he says, the foundation \"made money quickly available to allow for a meeting space in Kyiv. We reacted on the expressed needs of our project partners who changed an ongoing project [the exhibition space mentioned above].\" After the Maidan protests, it became more and more apparent that there were hardly any independent meeting spaces that community groups could use. The exhibition space will now be used for meetings.\n\nThe ERSTE Foundation also remains alert to the needs of its Ukrainian project partners. \"We have a higher degree of sensitivity when it comes to project applications from partners from a country that currently has more issues than others,\" says Gosejohann, so \"specifically Ukraine right now.\"\n\nInternational Renaissance Foundation\n\nThe International Renaissance Foundation has been working in Ukraine since 1991. Its main work, says deputy executive director Inna Pidluska, is supporting the efforts of CSOs active in promoting human rights, an independent judiciary, and the association agreement with the EU. However, when the Yanukovych government withdrew from the process of preparing for that agreement, some of IRF's long-time partners became involved in organizing pro-European integration demonstrations. Following the forcible dispersal of protestors from the Maidan on November 30, 2013, IRF announced its withdrawal from any form of collaboration or consultation with the Ukrainian government. Other civil society organizations followed their example.\n\nDuring the ensuing Maidan protests, IRF supported CSOs' right to protest peacefully, helped create forums where civil society groups and activists could meet, and funded independent media organizations that could report events from on the ground. Notable among these was Hromadske.tv, an independent online TV initiative, which, says Pidluska, became one of the most visited sources of information on the events surrounding the Maidan protest.\n\nIRF also coordinated and implemented a humanitarian solidarity program, providing relief to the victims of the crisis and medical aid for victims of the state repression of the protests. At the time, she explains it was dangerous for injured protestors to seek treatment because in some cases IRF has documented, protestors were taken into custody instead of being given medical aid.\n\nThe need for this has now receded, so IRF is wrapping up this program. (It's worth noting that this conversation took place before the escalation of events in east Ukraine, noted above.)\n\nWhat Next? Reconciliation and Reconstruction\n\nEastern and southern Ukraine continue to be unsettled. It is important for foundations to work with CSOs in these areas that are monitoring the situation with regard to human rights and civic freedoms, Pidluska says. Once violence is at an end, civil society will need to be involved in the opportunities for reconciliation between different communities that were on opposite sides of the political divide.\n\nPidluska underscores that such differences of view have existed for a long time, and they are not at the root of the violence. This is being \"inspired and funded from the outside,\" she said. When the armed militias are disarmed or dispersed, CSOs should be prepared \"to serve as mediators and conveners for building trust in these communities and moving beyond conflict,\" and foundations can be extremely important in developing such initiatives.\n\nThe Role of Women's Groups\n\nFor Madeleine Rees, secretary general of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, women's groups can have a crucial  though often overlooked  role in peace and reconciliation. According to Rees, WILFP's experience in Syria has led them to believe that \"women have a real knowledge of what is happening on the ground and how peaceful solutions can be brokered.\" In the case of Ukraine, \"the network of women's organizations in Ukraine gave us an excellent gender analysis.\" However, as a recent European Foundation Centre conference in Sarajevo heard, women are often excluded when it comes to peace processes, and as a result marginalized in the society that emerges beyond the conflict, to the detriment of women and wider society.\n\nUnderlying Questions\n\nBeyond the problems raised by the crisis in Ukraine are a number of long-running issues that helped to precipitate events in the first place.\n\nThe engagement of civil society in the reform of education, public service procurement, public health, and social policies are some of the areas IRF and its partners will be grappling with once the political situation is quieter. Another big issue for Pidluska is to improve the quality of governance at the local level, and especially to foster the ability of local communities to address the questions that concern them. Foundations have an important role in supporting this work, she thinks. In this context, she talks of the Reanimation Reform Package, a reform movement that arose from the Maidan protests and that is being supported by IRF and a number of international donors. This initiative looks both ways. It is intended not only to make representations to government but also to present to the people the need for reform and the implications if such reforms are not forthcoming.\n\nCorruption\n\nOne issue that cuts across most of the areas Pidluska highlights as needing reform is corruption. Most of those we spoke to identified this as a key issue. \"I think the most urgent problem in Ukraine now is fighting corruption,\" says Anna Babinets of Slidstvo.Info, an investigative journalism organization. \"People in our country really need transparency.\" Slidstvo.Info investigates instances of corruption and publicizes them through websites, newspapers, magazines, and television. As a member of the Yanukovych Leaks team, they continue to work with Ukraine's public prosecution service to help them investigate fraud and money laundering by the former president and his team.\n\nFighting corruption was one of the top demands of the Maidan protestors, and Pidluska also singles it out as a key priority. Civil society, she believes, must help to improve anti-corruption legislation and to monitor and advocate proper implementation of existing legislation. Besides acting as funders and partners for CSOs in this area, foundations need themselves to show an example, ensuring that standards and practices of good governance are adopted and acted upon in their own institutions.\n\nWhen and How to Intervene\n\n\"Every organization should work in the field it knows best,\" says Gosejohann. \"We look at building on the projects that already exist, though on a modest scale,\" he adds, and recommends that others \"continue to work with trusted partners with whom one has a good track record.\" There are a lot of new groups looking for funding in Ukraine, he points out. Funding is available, but the groups' provenance and intention is not always clear or appropriate, so \"credible donors have to continue to work with credible partners in well-considered, smaller interventions.[T]hat's the role of private foundations right now.\"\n\nPidluska says something very similar: foundations should \"continue doing what they used to do, which is working with their immediate constituencies.\"\n\nInternational foundations can also show their solidarity with civil society groups in Ukraine. The ERSTE Foundation, by its actions, says Gosejohann, is making it known that \"we as a foundation can be counted on we're not running away.\"\n\nFlexibility and Timing \n\nQuite small amounts can make a big difference. Madeleine Rees estimates that 50,000 would have enabled WIPLF to take representatives of Ukrainian women's organizations to Geneva to make their case to the member states and the human rights council. Often the timing of responses is crucial. As Rees notes, \"In every situation where there could be violent conflict, if you are upstream in terms of your analysis, you can intervene in good time\" and foundations' flexibility should allow them to do this. The ERSTE Foundation's size, believes Gosejohann, means it can move quickly and identify \"smaller, informal, effective projects.\" Besides, there is a practical question at stake: the foundation is active in more than a dozen countries in Central and Southeast Europe, and Ukraine is huge. \"We would be badly advised to say that we would take on a really big issue country-wide, so we do it with little pinches here and there where we know it will have a local or even a regional effect.\"\n\nCould Foundations Be Doing More?\n\n\"Foundations are already doing quite a lot,\" says Pidluska, noting that they are working across what she describes as a very broad spectrum of activities. She believes foundations in Ukraine could benefit from expanding their donor base and their access to resources for addressing vulnerable groups, which have grown since the crisis, especially in Crimea and in conflict zones. It has become especially difficult for foundations to work in the Crimea because it is subject to punitive Russian laws about foreign funding. Most foundations in the area have had to suspend their work, she says. \"We recognize that CSOs and foundations there are under extreme pressure and we cannot work with them as if it's business as usual.\"\n\nOne thing the crisis has highlighted is the inadequacy of the current philanthropic regime in Ukraine. At the moment, she says, money given as emergency support to victims' families is liable to taxes at a rate of 19 percent. In order to overcome this, the government has invoked special regulations that exempt specific kinds of funds from taxes. The philanthropic community wants such an exemption to become part of the law governing donations rather than being extended on a case-by-case basis. In addition, tax incentives for donors and the regulation of online giving need attention. The Ukrainian Donors Forum, which Pidluska chairs, has taken up the question of bringing Ukraine's philanthropic environment more generally into line with rest of Europe, with only partial success. Perhaps the crisis will underscore their demands.\n\nFor More Information\n\nTo keep track of developments in Ukraine, the Center for Strategic and International Studies has created an interactive timeline of events in Ukraine starting on March 6, 2014.\n\nIn the latest installment of our Alliance@PND series, Alliance magazine associate editor Andrew Milner takes a look at how foundations have been working to help people and institutions navigate the turbulent political climate in Ukraine....",

For several years, the GOP partly upheld its commitment by modestly curtailing spending growth and balancing the budget. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately, the balanced budgets of the late 1990s created an &quot;easy money&quot; mindset in Congress, which began a spending spree that continues unabated today. Total federal outlays will rise 29 percent between fiscal years 2001 and 2005 according to the president's fiscal year 2005 budget released in February. Real discretionary spending increases in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 are three of the five biggest annual increases in the last 40 years. Large spending increases have been the principal cause of the government's return to massive budget deficits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Although defense spending has increased in response to the war on terrorism, President Bush has made little attempt to restrain nondefense spending to offset the higher Pentagon budget. Nondefense discretionary outlays will increase about 36 percent during President Bush's first term in office. Congress has failed to contain the administration's overspending and has added new spending of its own. Republicans have clearly forfeited any claim of being the fiscally responsible party in Washington. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Looking ahead, Republicans need to rediscover the reforming spirit that they brought to Washington after the landmark 1994 congressional elections. Fiscally conservative Democrats should challenge big-spending Republicans and work to cut unneeded programs from both the defense and nondefense parts of the budget. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  In command of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives, Republicans are primarily responsible for the current budget mess, and it is Republicans who have the power to pare back spending to get the federal budget under control once again.",

Between 2009 and 2014, SVCF invested $2.4 million in 12 projects that used cultural tactics such as dialogue, film, photography and storytelling to deepen relationships and cross-cultural understanding throughout San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. Over the course of five years, these grantees, with support from SVCF, focused their activities on identifying and cementing shared values between immigrants and receiving communities, as well as building relationships within and across various communities in the region.",

They spend ever-increasing amounts of corporate resources on improving the social, human, and environmental conditions under which companies operate. Yet the world's problems seem as intractable as ever, and very few global companies have managed to rise above the public relations din to truly distinguish themselves through their CSR activities. One of the primary reasons CSR has not yet significantly improved society is that the nonprofit and business sectors are for the most part still stuck in their old stereotypical roles. By ceding responsibility for solving social problems to nonprofits, companies have forsaken their ability to intervene directly in healing the world's woes. As a result, some of the most sophisticated and powerful organizations in the world remain on the sidelines of social progress. Companies that get into the game and play to win will reap disproportionate social impact, economic rewards, and reputational benefits.",

The study was fielded by Knowledge Networks, which contacted a nationally representative sample of the recently unemployed between August 6 and 12, 2009.

        "content":"In spring 2006, Massachusetts enacted legislation to ensure universal health insurance coverage to all residents. The legislation was a hybrid of ideas from across the political spectrum, promoted by a moderately conservative Republican governor with national political aspirations, and passed by a liberal Democratic state House and Senate. Groups from across the political spectrum supported the plan, from the Heritage Foundation on the right to Families USA on the left, although the plan had detractors from across the political spectrum as well. This study briefly describes the basic structure of the Massachusetts plan and identifies the good, the bad, and the ugly. Although the legislation, as Stuart Altman put it, &quot;is not a typical Massachusetts -- Taxachusetts, oh -- just -- crazy -- liberal plan,&quot; there is enough &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; in the mix to raise serious concerns, particularly when the desire to overregulate the health insurance market appears to be hard -- wired into Massachusetts policymakers' DNA. If we want to make health insurance more affordable and avoid the &quot;bad&quot; and the &quot;ugly&quot; of the Massachusetts plan, Congress -- or, barring that, individual states -- should consider a &quot;regulatory federalism&quot; approach. Under such an approach, insurers and insurance purchasers would be required to subject themselves to the laws and regulations of a single state but allowed to select the state. As with corporate charters, this system would allow employers and insurers to select the regulatory regime that most efficiently and cost -- effectively matches the needs of their risk pools. The ability of purchasers and insurers to exit from the state's regulatory oversight (taking their premium taxes with them) would temper opportunistic behavior by legislators and regulators, including the temptation to impose inefficient mandates and otherwise overregulate.",

In the face of these obstacles, our survey of foundation payout behavior over 25 years reveals that most foundations simply pay out the mandated minimum amount each year, regardless of other relevant considerations. We argue that the minimum rate has gone from being a floor when it was enacted decades ago to a ceiling today.

Typically centered on the automobile and no longer bicycle- or pedestrian-friendly, cities deprive people of needed exercise, creating an imbalance between caloric intake and caloric expenditures. As a result, obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in cities in developing as well as industrial countries. With more than 1 billion people overweight worldwide, epidemiologists now see this as a public health threat of historic proportions -- a growing source of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a higher incidence of several forms of cancer. The evolution of modern cities is tied to advances in transport, initially for ships and trains, but it was the internal combustion engine combined with cheap oil that provided the mobility of people and freight that fueled the phenomenal urban growth of the twentieth century. As the world urbanized, energy use climbed.",

        "content":"&quot;Like a milking stool, society becomes dysfunctional if any leg is short or weak. The current argument is that civil society is the short, or weak, leg and thus our societal disarray.&quot; In this report to the Kettering Foundation, John McKnight examines this argument, making a case for the strengths of and the need for a stronger associational life for citizens.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  McKnight distinguishes associations from not-for-profit corporations, though they are often combined as the third leg of a &quot;three-legged stool,&quot; the other legs being business and government. He points out their differences: not-for-profit corporations are usually formal and hierarchical, whereas associations tend to be informal and horizontal; not-for-profits use the special knowledge of professionals and experts to perform their functions, while associations generally use the experience and knowledge of member citizens.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Society, McKnight argues, is actually like a four-legged stool, with associations being the fourth support. However, our focus on the three institutional legs has obscured the presence and vitality of the fourth.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Alexis de Tocqueville recognized this powerful role of citizens in a democracy -- the power of association. In associations, he saw Americans making power. In voting, he saw them delegating power. As our three major institutions are pulling back from local community space -- governments cut budgets, not-for-profits reduce programs, and businesses contract -- the need for an alternative source of production becomes clear. Our future well-being depends on our rediscovery and nurturing of the fourth leg of the American stool -- associational life.",

The past two years, the number of homeless children in Chicago Public Schools increased 24% , to 15,580 in 2010-11. The city of Chicago does a point-in-time count every other year to deter-mine the number of homeless people in shelters or on the street one night.

The AGSF report shows that despite this increase in spending, prosecutions for most types of firearm offenses are declining or remain below pre-Bush administration levels, and 20 of the 22 major federal gun laws are enforced so infrequently that they might as well not exist. Last year, for example, the Justice Department brought only:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 188 cases for gun trafficking, despite the recovery of 300,000 guns showing signs of trafficking. This represents a 5 percent decline in prosecutions from 2002 levels.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 32 cases against corrupt gun stores, even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) has concluded that &quot;dirty dealers&quot; are the leading source of firearms recovered in gun trafficking operations. Prosecutors in 29 states that are home to 50,675 licensed dealers filed not even one case against a gun retailer in 2003.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 532 cases for lying on a firearms background check form -- an 8% decrease -- even though more than 126,000 people submitted false information on the forms and despite Attorney General John Ashcroft's emphasis on pursuing these cases.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 5 cases for illegally selling a gun to a minor, even though more than 30,000 gun crimes were committed by youths age 17 or under;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 234 cases for possessing or selling a stolen firearm, despite nearly 40,000 stolen guns being recovered by law enforcement and returned to their rightful owner; and&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - 89 cases for possessing or selling a firearm with an obliterated serial number -- a sign that the gun was sold illegally -- despite the fact that police recover thousands of guns with missing serial numbers each year during criminal investigations.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The overall number of federal firearm prosecutions has increased in each of the last four years, rising from 7,124 in 2000 to 11,864 in 2003.

Now in its twentieth year, WITS serves over 12,500 at-risk students each year and is a major force for educational change in the Houston area. The organization's ideas and practices  utilized by writers-in-residence, demonstrated in their partnerships with classroom teachers, and distributed through publications  have changed the way writing is taught and practiced in hundreds of classrooms. Houston Independent School District Superintendent Kaye Stripling has observed that \"WITS students tend to be motivated to become life-long learners and confident in their powers of communication.\"\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nWITS main program  Writer-in-Residence  focuses on at-risk, inner city youths. A professional poet, fiction writer, or playwright visits classrooms to lead weekly creative writing workshops. Students receive an anthology of their work, go on field trips to museums for writing tours, and learn from visual or performing artists about the connection between writing and other forms of art. WITS helps participating teachers by providing them with writing workshops and professional development opportunities.\n\nIn addition to the Writer-in-Residence program, WITS also offers workshops in art museums, hospitals, community centers, private schools, and juvenile detention centers. It is also involved in national initiatives, designing writing curricula, and mentoring new writers-in-schools programs.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nRecently ranked the top literary arts organization in the state by the Texas Commission on the Arts, WITS has proven itself in successful projects across the city of Houston. Through effective leadership, WITS has increased the number of children it serves by over 20 percent in each of the past four years.\n\nWITS has become the model for literacy and creative writing programs nationwide. Using grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, WITS has mentored five similar writing organizations since 1997 in Detroit, Seattle, Missoula, and Boise. This group has expanded to include organizations from Portland, San Francisco, and New York and has launched a national consortium to support existing WITS programs, share resources, and help start new programs in other communities.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe WITS Web site provides information about the organization's programs, its writer/teachers, and participating schools. It also has a links page that directs users to sites about similar programs throughout the country, literary projects and organizations in Houston, and writing in general.\n\n\nFunding:\nGenerous multi-year commitments from the Menil Foundation, the Houston Endowment, and the Brown Foundation indicate the community's confidence in the WITS program. WITS is a financially strong organization, maintaining a $70,000 cash reserve to manage cash flows and drawing almost 50 percent of its annual operating revenues from earned income sources.",

        "content":"How do you go about delivering reliable energy to poor, off-the-grid villages in India? If you're an established energy company, you don't.\n\nEnter Decentralised Energy Systems (DESI Power), a young, India-based power company that built a biomass gasification plant that runs on inexpensive agricultural residues such as ipomoea, a weed plentiful throughout the Indian countryside. DESI's power plant in the village of Baharbari provides a cheap, clean source of electricity that the village uses to meet local microenterprises' and agricultural laborers' needs, such as pumping water and charging batteries. Indeed, the driving idea behind DESI Power is to make a profit from designs that fall outside the standard power generation model, and in doing so to create worthwhile jobs and economic growth in places that the government has all but forgotten. DESI does make a profit: The company generates a 10 percent return on its investment by building, owning, and operating the power plants before eventually turning them over to local power producers.\n\nBut DESI Power is the exception. Though there is literally a world of opportunities for firms to meet basic demand for housing, water, energy, medical insurance, legal and financial services, and much more in developing markets, few are doing so. According to a recent Ashoka report, large companies have tapped only about 20 percent of new markets.Corporations often draw workers from these populations, but rarely do they flip the equation and develop products, services, and brands that target the poor's basic social and infrastructure needs.\n\nWhy is serious investment in bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) markets the exception rather than the rule? What keeps companies from building lines of business by meeting the needs of the poor in developing markets?\n\nFirst, and perhaps most fundamentally, these new markets look awfully different from the standardized markets of the West. Even firms that recognize opportunities in developing markets sense that going about business as usual in these places is like trying to fit a square peg into a decidedly round hole.\n\nWeak infrastructure creates challenges to product distribution that range from uncertain to insurmountable. Some Indian companies have gone so far as to build their own roads, power systems, and phone networks  powerful signals that developing markets are worth the hassle, but not exactly a siren call to entice eager new entrants. Income  particularly the disposable kind  is low, and cultural differences make certain products or services unsuitable. For example, because the Koran prohibits interest, paid or received, banks pursuing Muslim customers need alternatives to loans.\n\nThis leads us to the second barrier: Most companies don't know how to package products for poor people, and they don't know what products and services the poor prefer. Too often, bottom-of-the-pyramid business plans simply repackage consumer goods popular in developed markets to fit the price range of emerging market customers. Retail-focused companies such as Unilever have, indeed, earned new customers with this strategy: Unilever's Lux soap, Sunsilk shampoo, and Lipton tea are becoming household staples in India and South Africa. But consumer goods are, in many cases, peripheral to a more substantial opportunity with a wider potential customer base in developing markets  namely, meeting the basic demand for housing, clean water, medical insurance, and legal and financial services that fit local needs, customs, and income.\n\nA third barrier, ironically, is that business investments in social and infrastructure needs often face the highest regulatory hurdles. This is a byproduct of how policymakers and nonprofits often approach the needs of the poor, which are mostly handled within the realm of social or government work. Charity and government subsidies are certainly important stopgap measures to meet the poor's social and infrastructure needs, particularly when sudden needs arise. But economists often talk about the way these stopgaps crowd out private investment if they're adopted as long-term measures.\n\nThe result is that governments and charities  purposefully or unwittingly  deny the poor the chance to make basic choices about their own needs and well-being. When the poor are enclosed in a bubble of protective policy, the links that provide accountability in the marketplace between consumers and suppliers disappear.\n\nThe Grassroots Solution\n\nBut there is another way to look at developing markets. Rather than starting with the status quo in rich countries and measuring business opportunities in poor ones by gauging what it would take to recreate that environment, businesses can take a step back and do what entrepreneurs have always done: ask questions like \"What do people need?\" \"Why don't they have it?\" and \"How do they get it?\"\n\nThat approach is the essence of grassroots design. Though it requires more initial thought and creativity, it makes things far simpler in the long run. Businesses that start with a grassroots design process end up with products and services that meet real, as opposed to perceived, needs; integrate local materials and processes; and reflect the culture and aesthetic of their customers. Of course, a company that embraces grassroots design does not gain the benefits of simply importing its existing business model and product line. But mass markets are fragmenting everywhere, and firms that learn to design up from local circumstances will compete better wherever they operate.\n\nMost firms that wholeheartedly embrace grassroots design are small, but they have striking stories to tell. Natura Fibretech bases its booming business on Coirply, an inexpensive alternative to wood that it developed from coconut fiber, which grows throughout India. The Bangalorebased company is growing 40 percent per year because it redesigned this local resource  which for generations has been used to make rope and doormats  into a product significantly cheaper than plywood but comparable in quality to the best hardwoods on the market.\n\nNatura creates thousands of high-paying local jobs, most of them filled by women, by selling local enterprises the technology to harvest coconut fiber. The company then buys this material back and manufactures it for commercial use in everything from India's booming housing market to durable bedsprings for affordable, comfortable mattresses. As Natura's business expands in India and abroad, the company will be even better positioned to offer low-cost, high-quality products to poor customers.\n\nOf course, grassroots design doesn't always produce radically new, locally sourced products. In some instances, it simply yields new processes that fit existing products to local markets. Mexican food services company Cuadritos, for instance, has developed a proprietary chemical engineering process that creates safe, nutritious, flavorful food products out of the 17,000 tons of expired yogurt, soy milk, vegetables, and other foods that Mexicans throw out daily. The company starts by collecting waste from large-scale food producers such as Dannon and ends up with protein-rich cookies, instant soups, yogurt drinks, and soy powder at affordable prices. (Packages designed to feed one family for a week cost just $3.20.)\n\nBut how can big companies integrate grassroots design? Often, creative partnerships provide the best opportunities. The resources and know-how of a large corporation, together with the creative thinking and practical experience of those in the social sector, can quickly meet a specific need, something that has eluded aid organizations and government agencies for years.\n\nTake CEMEX, one of the top three global cement manufacturers, which partnered with a local social service organization to better serve the housing needs of Mexico's low-income population. CEMEX did not need to develop new products. It needed new financing, delivery, and service arrangements that would generate cost-efficient sales to groups (not just to individuals); ensure the timely delivery of materials; and provide technical advice to do-it-yourselfers. CEMEX now serves a new market representing potential sales of $500 million to $600 million per year. In less than 10 years, this CEMEX initiative has acquired a larger client base than all subsidized housing programs in Mexico combined.\n\nEveryone benefits from businesses designed on a grassroots level. Businesses gain access to pertinent market research. Social service providers that partner with businesses gain insight into how the corporation relates to its customers, a share of revenues, and the crucial feedback link that markets offer. Local entrepreneurs gain an outlet for their ideas. And poor customers are presented with a rare prospect: a product that meets their basic needs, tailored to their lifestyle and dependent on their own initiative and investment.\n\nHow do you go about delivering reliable energy to poor, off-the-grid villages in India? If you're an established energy company, you don't. Enter Decentralised Energy Systems (DESI Power), a young, India-based power company that built a biomass gasification plant that runs on inexpensive agricultural residues such as ipomoea, a weed plentiful throughout the Indian countryside....",

Knight Foundation, The Wait We Carry is an interactive tool designed to highlight the extensive backlog of disability claims at the Veterans Administration. Based on a survey of veterans and their family members, the tool visualizes details related to how long individual veterans had to wait or have been waiting to receive support in response to their claims, as well as the emotional and financial stress caused by delays in the process. Developed in partnership with Periscopic, an information visualization firm, the tool is intended to show that there's a person behind every data point and to encourage journalists and the public to learn more about the VA backlog and demand accountability from and change at the department.\n\n\nOutstanding Web Features:\nVisitors to the site can view bar graphs of individual veterans' wait times compared with the VA's own internal targets and the overall average wait time; narrow the sample by state, combat operation, or year the claim was filed; and/or sort the data by wait time, filing year, state, or date of data submission. Each data entry includes details such as the veteran's branch of service, rank, number of days he/she waited or has been waiting for benefits, number of days deployed, disabilities claimed, and levels of emotional and financial stress. Those who wish to contact a veteran about his/her experience can do so via a Web form, while reporters can narrow the sample to survey respondents who are available for interviews. Additional graphs highlight average wait times and most frequent injury claims filed for the specific sample selected. Veterans can add their profiles to the database through the site, while supporters can sign a petition to end the backlog or make a donation to support the tool.\n\nThe Wait We Carry Web site enables individual veteransto tell their disability claims stories....",

The report, Delinquency: The Untold Story of Student Loan Borrowing (44 pages, PDF), examined the experiences of borrowers who began repayment between 2004 and 2009 and found that 15 percent defaulted at some point, 26 percent became delinquent but did not default, and 23 percent used deferment or forbearance to postpone their payments. Those who left school without a credential, last borrowed after attending college for a year or less, or attended a for-profit or two-year public institution were at higher risk of becoming delinquent or defaulting. And even when delinquency does not result in default, the authors note, it may affect the borrower's credit scores and ability to borrow in the future. Among other things, the report calls for more proactive debt management strategies, including engaging borrowers early, looking at a borrower's overall financial situation, and providing financial advice through a third party.",

Given the critical role women play in efforts to achieve the millennium development goals, that gender gap harms not only women but also their families, communities, and countries. Indeed, the longer a woman has had access to the Internet, the report finds, the more likely she is to engage in activities that yield tangible benefits.

Since its inception, the organization has recruited and trained more than ten thousand new teachers and started thirty-nine programs in eighteen states.\n\nTNTP has worked with an impressive list of clients, including the New York City Department of Education, the District of Columbia Public Schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Atlanta Public Schools, the Arkansas State Department of Education, and Mercy College in New York. TNTP's scale of involvement with its clients is significant, with its 2002 programs responsible for delivering more than 20 percent of all new teachers in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; and San Jose, California.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nTNTP offers strategic and operational consulting for the recruitment, selection, pre-service training, and ongoing support of new teachers across the country. After performing a comprehensive analysis of a school district's current operations, TNTP makes recommendations and helps district staff implement new ideas.\n\nSchool districts, state agencies, and universities can turn to TNTP for assistance in training mid-career professionals who do not have a background in education for alternative-certification programs, as well as for help in recruiting high-quality, certified teachers in high-need areas, such as math, science, and special education. The group develops recruitment plans, selection models with rigorous criteria, and training institutes for new teachers. For districts and other groups that want to jumpstart recruitment efforts, TNTP also offers short-term training modules on topics such as recruiter training and recruiter selection.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nIn September 2003, TNTP released a report that shows how urban districts often struggle to fill vacancies with high-quality teachers. Based on an analysis of hiring processes at four urban school districts, Missed Opportunities: How We Keep High Quality Teachers Out of Urban Classrooms (64 pages, PDF) reveals that the districts received many more applications than they had vacancies, with up to 37 percent of the candidates applying to teach in high-need areas such as math, science, special education, and bilingual education. But by the time urban districts made job offers, many applicants had already accepted positions in suburban areas. The report outlines factors that contribute to urban districts' hiring problems, including delays in state budget timetables and union seniority rules, and it suggests strategies to improve the hiring process.\n\n\nWeb site:\nThe TNTP Web site clearly explains the organization's mission, goals, and client services. In addition to the Who We Are and What We Do sections, the site features a list of clients and news about the organization.\n\n\nFunding:\nTNTP receives funding from government, foundation, and corporate sources, including the U.S. Department of Education, the Annie E.

Her fourth book, The Joy of Fundraising, is a confidently optimistic look at the fundraising process and how it can be transformed from a necessary chore into an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe book's subtitle, \"How to Stop Suffering and Start Enjoying Asking for Money for Your Favorite Cause,\" makes clear its intended audience: new or inexperienced fundraisers struggling with the task of how to ask for money. However, because Axelrod is largely concerned with developing donors who are committed to long-term giving, even veteran fundraisers will benefit from her coaching and approach, which is focused on helping any organization, regardless of size, mission, or need, create sustainability in its fundraising.\n\nTo that end, she breaks her Benevon model down into three components: thinking, focus, and action. Essential to each, she notes, is the creation of a personal connection between an organization and a donor. Along the way, she introduces some interesting ideas, including creating an \"essential story\" for the organization, developing a \"treasure map\" highlighting connections to potential donors, and showcasing a \"visionary leader\" of the organization  all of which serve to strengthen the connection between an organization and its actual and potential donors. If the jargon becomes a little repetitive at times, the strategies and tips the author offers are both practical and easy to absorb.\n\nThroughout, Axelrod is upbeat and enthusiastic  a significant strength of the book  and the reader is left with the feeling that raising money can indeed be an enjoyable activity. Where the book falls flat is in expanding on the ideas it introduces. By the end, experienced fundraisers might be left with the impression they've been given a pep talk or have read an expanded brochure for the author's training organization. Less experienced fundraisers, on the other hand, will benefit from Axelrod's explanation of her approach and examination of a process, more art than science, that is critical to the success of any nonprofit organization.\n\nAxelrod, a veteran fundraiser and trainer, shows how the fundraising process can be transformed from a necessary chore into an enjoyable experience....",

        "title":"Patronizing the Arts",
        "content":"America is a consumer society; from food to clothes to cars to movies, we occupy ourselves with buying and \"consuming\" the goods that others produce. And because we are quick to put a dollar value on just about everything (even carbon emissions!), it should come as no surprise that, as a society, we are obsessed with the value of particular artworks as well as the people who make them. From an early age, we are taught to esteem artistic achievement as the cornerstone of our civilization. At the same time, we are equally conditioned to measure art's worth in terms of time and money  against the seemingly infinite universe of stuff we spend our lives consuming. Little wonder, then, that 96 percent of Americans say they are greatly inspired by art, but only 27 percent believe that artists  and the art they produce  contribute to the good of society. Put another way, Americans think art is great, but they really don't want to pay for it.\n\nIn Patronizing the Arts, Marjorie Garber, chair of Harvard University's Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, lays bare the fundamental conundrum of Americans and their relationship to art: we are at once patrons and patronizing. Whether through government, foundations, universities or private charitable giving, Americans annually spend billions of dollars in support of the arts but give short shrift to the art creation process and frequently denigrate those who dare to think of \"artist\" as an actual job. That, says Garber, who has written widely on topics ranging from Shakespeare to human sexuality, is because Americans are fundamentally mercantile in their world view. And in a society focused on the exchange of goods for profit, she adds, it's little wonder that the average office jockey cannot comprehend a painter being supported so that he can paint. Let him paint away on his own time, most Americans will say, and if what he produces is worth anything, then someone's sure to buy it.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that artists have to eat and need a roof over their heads, both of which cost money. In her exceptionally literate book, Garber (who adroitly references Madonna, Borges, Freud, and Frank Gehry in virtually the same breath) focuses on what it would take to build a sustainable environment where art as process, and not merely product, is acknowledged and fostered by the society at large. To do so, says Garber, we need to think differently; in fact, we need to do away with the entire concept of \"arts patronage.\" The arts patron, she tells us, is an ill-conceived and outmoded model. And while the arts cannot as yet do without the hundreds of millions of dollars patrons annually contribute, we need to purge ourselves of the notion that money given in support of the arts is little more than a handout for people who would be more productively employed doing something else.\n\nBorrowing a page from government and private support for science, Garber instead calls for the re-imagining of arts patronage as \"big art.\" We don't think of funding for cancer research as charity; it's an investment in public health and the well being of humanity. So why not think about the arts in similar terms? Instead of conceiving of funding for the arts as the largess of a privileged class bestowed on the talented (albeit idle) few, why not make actual investments in creativity?\n\nOf course, it's not as though government, foundations, arts institutions, and universities aren't already doing that. Garber acknowledges as much as she ticks off the names of many organizations and institutions that have bought into that premise, from the Ford, MacArthur, and Rockefeller foundations, to the NEA/NEH, to academic institutions such as Juilliard, Columbia, Harvard, and Yale. And because she is both an academic and director of Harvard's Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, it's not surprising that her solution to the conundrum she describes is to aggressively expand funding for the arts on American college campuses. Alongside \"big science,\" not to mention \"big sports,\" Garber would like to see colleges become something far more than the diploma mills many of them seem to be. Students need to \"live the arts,\" not just get good grades in art history en route to law school, she writes. Indeed, hers is, in many ways, a return to an earlier ideal of the university as a transformative environment that shapes the mind and world view of those lucky enough to attend one.\n\nStill, it's not clear that more funding for the arts at the university level will break us of our habit of taking art and artists for granted; were we to double investments in the arts across the board, it would still only be pennies on the dollar to what we willingly spend on movies, pop music, and video games. It isn't because we live in an age lacking in exceptionally gifted artists or that artists go ignored. (Garber herself is a huge fan of Yo-Yo Ma.) To borrow a phrase, the fault might not be in our stars, but in ourselves.\n\nIndeed, given the invasive  some would say corrosive  effect of consumer culture on how we choose to live our lives, we may have already passed the point of no return. Garber would disagree, reminding us that no civilization can long survive without great art. But if she's right, there is much work to do and little time to waste. It remains to be seen, of course, whether our efforts will result in the foundation of a new appreciation for the arts  or amount to little more than a few last sandbags holding back a rising tide of twenty-first-century materialism.\n\nMarjorie Garber, chair of Harvard University's Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, calls for a new attitude toward and the creation of a more robust organizational infrastructure for the arts in America....",

        "title":"The New Volunteer Workforce",
        "content":"Most nonprofit CEOs would love to have a person like Jim working for them. Jim has thirteen years of financial experience at General Electric Co. and twenty-eight years at J.P. Morgan, and he currently works for the March of Dimes Foundation doing strategic planning, marketing, information technology, training, and research. Jim is not, however, a full-time employee. Rather, Jim is a 77-year-old volunteer. Jim enjoyed his volunteer work at the March of Dimes so much that his wife, Sari, joined him. Her volunteer position includes recruiting other volunteers  and she's pretty good at it. In 2007, she helped recruit forty-two volunteers who donated a total of more than 11,000 hours, valued at an estimated $200,000 of in-kind services. In addition to volunteering, Jim and Sari are donors  members of the March of Dimes' President's Society  and have convinced the rest of their family to participate. Their daughter, Beth, raised $3,000 over two years through the March of Dimes' March for Babies walkathon, and Beth's 12-year-old son is now forming his own walking team. Already into their third year of service, Jim and his family are creating a large amount of value for the March of Dimes. And the March of Dimes is just one of the organizations where they volunteer.\n\nAs Jim and Sari illustrate, volunteering, when channeled correctly, can be a highly valuable asset. The March of Dimes, however, is one of the few organizations that use volunteers effectively. Sadly, most nonprofits do not view their volunteers as strategic assets and have not developed ways to take full advantage of them. In fact, most nonprofits are losing staggering numbers of volunteers every year. Of the 61.2 million people who volunteered in 2006, 21.7 million  more than one-third  did not donate any time to a charitable cause the following year. Because these volunteers gave about 1.9 billion hours in 2006, and the value of their donated time was about $20 per hour, that adds up to about $38 billion in lost volunteer time in one year.\n\nAs impressive as the $38 billion figure is, the actual lost value might be even greater. If a nonprofit were paying someone to handle the jobs that Jim and Sari do, the cost would be much more than $20 an hour. Volunteers can do much more than stuff envelopes.\n\nA few nonprofits have grasped this concept and are taking what we call a talent management approach  investing in the infrastructure to recruit, develop, place, recognize, and retain volunteer talent. These are the savvy managers who recognize that there is a new national momentum and opportunity to engage more Americans to help solve America's intensifying social and environmental problems. Despite the recent national attention generated by the first-ever ServiceNation Presidential Candidates Forum, a new bipartisan legislative proposal to expand support for volunteering and service, and the emergence of cabinet-level positions on volunteering in two states, most nonprofits are still letting volunteer talent slip away like water through a leaky bucket.\n\nNonprofits Need More Talent\n\nThe nonprofit sector desperately needs the professional skills offered by volunteers. The nation's nonprofits are under strain from the current economic crisis, a leadership drain as older executives retire, and high turnover among younger nonprofit staff. Volunteers are an undervalued and underused resource for tackling these challenges.\n\nVolunteers, for example, can help nonprofits save money by providing technology services, developing programs, training staff, and conducting strategic planning, all without being paid a salary. Volunteers can also ease financial pressures by helping nonprofits raise money. Volunteers are effective fundraisers because their personal commitment to the organization's mission makes them convincing advocates for the cause. In addition, volunteers are likely to donate to the organization at which they serve. Despite these benefits, few nonprofits use wide-scale volunteer mobilization as a principal funding strategy.\n\nAnd it's not just money that's tight. The nonprofit sector is also facing a leadership crisis. Research has found that nonprofits can expect to lose more than 50 percent of their current leadership by 2010. Nonprofits also face high turnover rates among mid- and entry-level professional staff. A 2007 study by the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network found that 45 percent of nonprofit workers predict that their next job will not be at a nonprofit. These young staffers cited burnout among the top reasons for leaving.\n\nTo alleviate staff burnout, nonprofits can bring in older, experienced volunteers. Retired baby boomer volunteers can mentor young nonprofit professionals, leading to improved staff morale and lower turnover. Volunteers can also take on leadership roles formerly performed by paid staff. In some instances, volunteers can even manage paid staff.\n\nSome work is simply best performed by volunteers. Local volunteers may know their community's assets, important players, and underlying challenges better than any paid staff person, helping the nonprofit stay connected to the community. Volunteers can also serve as evangelists to the larger community, helping to promote the nonprofit and its mission.\n\nWhy Volunteer Talent Leaves\n\nNational volunteer rates are declining. Between 2005 and 2006, the percent of volunteers who did not do any volunteering the following year increased from 32 percent to 36 percent. Although nonprofits can expect, and in some cases even desire, some attrition, losing more than one out of three volunteers from one year to the next is clearly a problem.\n\nWhy are volunteers opting out? The 2003 Volunteer Management Capacity Study conducted by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS, the organization we are affiliated with), the Urban Institute, and the UPS Foundation provides some clues. The study concludes that fewer than half of nonprofits that manage volunteers have adopted a significant number of important volunteer management practices. Here are five of the main reasons why volunteers are not returning.\n\nNot Matching Volunteers' Skills with Assignments. Volunteers with valuable and specialized skills are often dispatched to do manual labor rather than tasks that use their professional talents. The prime goals of corporate volunteer programs, for example, are building teams and increasing morale, which are most easily accomplished by groups of people doing manual labor: every spring in cities across the country, hundreds of professionals turn out to paint walls and plant flowers at local schools. Although this has its time and place, most community organizations really need an ongoing involvement that taps volunteers' professional skills rather than a onetime project that uses their manual labor. Volunteers often don't get much out of the experience, either. Many of these volunteers get an empty feeling when they know that the job they've been given is make-work or a photo op.\n\nFailing to Recognize Volunteers' Contributions. Nonprofits need to recognize volunteers both through an organizational culture that values them and through specific appreciation ceremonies and events. In their annual reports, most nonprofits list all individual donors categorized by the amount of money they have donated. Very few nonprofits, however, do the same for people who donate their time. Naming individual volunteers with the number of hours they have contributed (and perhaps the dollar value) is one way to demonstrate a culture that values volunteers. The Capital Area Food Bank of Texas does this and also profiles individual volunteers in its annual report.\n\nNot Measuring the Value of Volunteers. Most nonprofits do not measure the dollar value that volunteers provide to their organization. This reflects the lack of seriousness with which many organizations view volunteers and tends to compound the problem. If nonprofit leaders had hard data demonstrating the value of volunteers, as the March of Dimes does, they would be more likely to invest more time and money in developing volunteer talent.\n\nFailing to Train and Invest in Volunteers and Staff. Volunteers need training to understand the organizations with which they are working, and employees need to be trained to work with volunteers. Nonprofits rarely invest substantial amounts of time or money in volunteer recruiters and managers. For example, a youth service organization in Florida reported that at one time it had a busy receptionist managing several hundred volunteers. Unfortunately, the receptionist model of volunteer management is all too common. Nationally, one-third of paid nonprofit staff who manage volunteers have never had \"any formal training in volunteer administration, such as coursework, workshops, or attendance at conferences that focus on volunteer management.\"\n\nFailing to Provide Strong Leadership. Most nonprofit leaders are simply not taking the time to develop or support volunteer talent adequately  resulting in a poor or bland experience that gives a volunteer little reason to return. Most nonprofit leaders do not place a high value on volunteer talent. If they did, they would dedicate more resources to the task  not assign it to a receptionist. When told of this article, the CEO of a large national youth service organization said, \"I think you're on to something: 90 percent of our labor is performed by volunteers, yet our strategic plan makes no mention of them.\"\n\nWhy isn't volunteering more respected? Why aren't more organizations investing in volunteering? One problem may lie with the term itself. The word \"volunteer\" doesn't say anything about the nature of the service provided, except implying that it is free. It is often assumed that something free is not valuable. Maybe we should use different words  like fundraiser, project manager, or legal counsel  that describe the work performed and help erode outdated ideas about the value of the volunteer workforce.\n\nVoluntarism also suffers from being thought of as something that is nice, but not necessary. When people think of volunteers, they often envision people spending a day cleaning up trash or planting flowers  projects that are helpful, but not essential. If the volunteer had not planted those flowers, would the nonprofit have paid someone else to do it? When nonprofit leaders see that volunteers can do highly skilled work that the organization would have otherwise paid for, volunteering will begin to get some respect.\n\nCapitalizing on Volunteer Talent\n\nTo capitalize on the opportunity presented by volunteer talent, nonprofit leaders need to expand their vision of volunteering, integrate volunteers into their strategic planning, and reinvent the way that their organizations support and manage volunteer talent.\n\nIf nonprofit leaders want highly skilled volunteers to come and stay, they need to expand their vision of volunteering by creating an experience that is meaningful for the volunteer, develops skills, demonstrates impact, and taps into volunteers' abilities and interests. More people need to understand that people will make time to volunteer if they are stimulated and engaged. Our research shows that the primary difference between volunteers and non-volunteers, when measuring what they do with their time, is the amount of television they watch. People who do not volunteer watch hundreds of hours of additional TV a year compared to people who do volunteer. It's not that people don't have enough time to volunteer. People do not volunteer because nonprofits do not provide them with volunteer opportunities that interest them enough to pull them away from their television sets.\n\nRethinking Work Roles. To create compelling opportunities for volunteers, a nonprofit's management team should begin by evaluating the degree to which important roles could be performed by volunteers. Some organizations are elevating the roles of volunteers and blurring the distinctions between paid and nonpaid staff. At the American Red Cross, for example, a volunteer chairperson runs the volunteer division and supervises paid staff. At the March of Dimes, people often move back and forth from senior paid positions to volunteer positions. Nonprofits also need to explore hybrid models of work and volunteering such as Experience Corps and ReServe. In these programs, people receive a modest stipend for their sustained and high-impact service, ensuring that people of varying income levels can participate.\n\nAssigning Appropriate Tasks. Nonprofits must assign volunteers jobs that make the most of their skills and talents. For example, marketing experts from the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche were preparing for a traditional volunteer project  taking stock of donated inventory at a thrift store operated by Catholic Charities USA. But the Deloitte workers saw ways the thrift store could employ new merchandising techniques and offered pro bono consulting services to help make the changes. The changes the Deloitte volunteers suggested produced strong results: average monthly revenue at the store rose 20 percent. Catholic Charities was planning to use Deloitte employees to sort pants and shirts, which would have returned a value close to minimum wage. Instead, Deloitte employees put their analytic and consulting skills to work and returned a value of approximately $150 per hour. Not only do nonprofits get more value from using highly skilled volunteers to perform highly skilled functions, but these volunteers are also more likely to offer their services again. CNCS research found that volunteers who engage in less challenging activities tend to be less likely to continue volunteering the following year. Only 53 percent of volunteers who did \"general labor\" activities or supplied transportation continued volunteering the following year. By contrast, 74 percent of volunteers performing professional or management activities continued volunteering.\n\nCreating Bonding Experiences. One of the best ways that nonprofits can engage volunteers is to create experiences that develop strong attachments between the volunteer and the organization. The March of Dimes, for example, is constantly thinking about how to channel the interest of a onetime volunteer into a more sustained commitment. A volunteer might walk in the March for Babies two years in a row and then drop out. That person has not necessarily lost her passion for helping babies, she just needs a new challenge and more opportunities to stay involved. To keep her engaged, the March of Dimes might ask her to speak with groups of expectant moms on the importance of folic acid and prenatal checkups. That could lead to her managing a local fundraising event or recruiting corporate sponsors. The March of Dimes has found that by increasing responsibility, tailoring assignments to volunteer interests, and providing training and in-person networking opportunities, they are able to hang on to more volunteers.\n\nSupporting and Training Volunteers. Nonprofits also need to support their volunteers. The American Cancer Society, for example, respects and cares for volunteers in the same manner that the organization cares for its own staff. Their chief talent officer ensures that staff and volunteers participate together in orientation and training classes and work together on important projects such as creating curriculum, delivering quality-of-life programs to cancer patients and their families, and serving as community health liaisons. The American Cancer Society also expects its staff to recruit and work with community volunteers, and it enforces this through performance reviews that measure volunteer engagement.\n\nUsing New Technology. New technologies allow nonprofits to communicate with volunteers inexpensively and to build social networks that connect volunteers with one another and with the nonprofit. Organizations like VolunteerMatch and Zazengo have developed technology that makes it easy for volunteers to find opportunities based on their needs, interests, and skills. With this technology, volunteers no longer need to go to a Web site to search for opportunities; the right ones come to them. Technology also allows people to volunteer without having to leave their homes. One of our colleagues, for example, develops and maintains Web sites pro bono without leaving her home.\n\nDeveloping Strategic Plans. To make effective use of volunteer talent, nonprofit leaders must integrate volunteers into their strategic plans. In 2007, the leaders of eleven major nonprofit organizations and the authors of this article met to discuss ways to engage volunteers and laid out the ingredients for this process. Nonprofit participants such as Goodwill Industries, United Way of America, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America zeroed in on strategic planning as the most critical and neglected step in managing volunteers. By treating volunteers as the valuable resource they are, nonprofits get more challenging work done, reap the benefit of more volunteer hours, and incur fewer costs associated with having to replace lost volunteers each year.\n\nAttracting a New Wave of Volunteer Talent\n\nEven with the best planning and management, nonprofits will always need to recruit new volunteers to support new or expanded programs and to replace those volunteers who inevitably stop coming. The most promising places for nonprofits to recruit new volunteer talent are among retired baby boomers, young people (millennials), businesses, and religious organizations.\n\nRetiring baby boomers offer nonprofits experience, management skills, and vast numbers. Older American volunteers will increase 50 percent by 2020. Boomers are also healthier and more educated, and they are predicted to live longer than their parents. Perhaps half of these people will continue working into their 70s, which should ultimately encourage more volunteering later in life. Although one might assume that older people with jobs are less likely to volunteer, working appears to encourage people to stay more connected with their community and maintain social networks that promote volunteering.\n\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, America's young people are increasingly interested in making a difference. One recent study revealed that 68 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 26 prefer to work for a company that provides professional volunteer opportunities. This trend is likely to continue. The UCLA Higher Education Research Institute reported in 2005 a 25-year high in first-year students' belief that it is \"essential or important to help others.\"\n\nPro bono business services are another emerging source of talent. In February 2008, CNCS joined with the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation to bring together more than one hundred and fifty business, government, and nonprofit leaders in a summit on pro bono services. The summit identified the benefits to companies of providing pro bono services and sought to expand the pro bono ethic (typically identified with the legal profession) throughout the corporate community. Summit participants kicked off \"A Billion + Change,\" a three-year campaign to leverage $1 billion in skilled volunteering and pro bono services from the corporate community. To date, more than twenty-three companies have pledged more than $400 million in professional services.\n\nReligious partnerships are a largely untapped area of volunteer talent: 85 percent of nonprofits with secular missions report that they do not have one partnership with a religious group. This religious-secular divide is all the more troubling when one considers the tremendous opportunity religious organizations offer: More people volunteer through religious organizations than any other kind of organization, and religious volunteers often engage in substantial work outside their congregation.\n\nFormer Philadelphia mayor Reverend W. Wilson Goode Sr.'s Amachi program spearheaded an effective secular-religious partnership that included Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, AmeriCorps VISTA, and local religious congregations across the country. Amachi had the kids who need mentoring, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America had the mentoring expertise, the congregations had people who want to mentor, and VISTA coordinated the collaboration.\n\nNonprofits can also use religious organizations to expand their reach into the African-American, Hispanic, and Asian communities. Each group does more than one-third of all their volunteering with religious groups. It is particularly important for nonprofits to tap into these communities, because racial minority populations are growing as a percentage of the overall U.S. population.\n\nThriving With Volunteer Talent\n\nSari (the March of Dimes volunteer we profiled at the beginning of this article) helped produce the equivalent of $200,000 worth of labor in one year. What was March of Dimes' investment in Sari? About $13,000 a year. That represents a return of more than fifteen times the organization's investment. And Sari is just one volunteer in the March of Dimes' offices.\n\nOlder, educated volunteers like Sari and Jim have the potential to perform valuable and highly skilled work, donate money, and activate social networks that multiply the impact of their individual contributions. By 2020, there will be millions more like them, thanks to the coming wave of retiring baby boomers. Simultaneously, companies are providing more opportunities for working professionals to engage in pro bono and volunteer work, as part of the company's efforts to recruit and retain the most talented people.\n\nThis surge in professional people interested in putting their skills to good use creates a tremendous opportunity for nonprofits. The sector can't squander that opportunity by assigning these volunteers to nice but not mission-critical work. Social entrepreneurs, nonprofit executives, and other public service leaders need to modernize their understanding of the value of unpaid work and embrace volunteer talent of all ages as an important way to fulfill their mission.\n\nA new wave of volunteer talent is building. Some nonprofit leaders will take advantage of this opportunity and exponentially increase their impact; the rest will be left behind trying to make do the old way.\n\nNonprofits rely heavily on volunteers, but most CEOs do a poor job of managing them. As a result, more than one-third of those who volunteer one year do not donate their time the next year  at any nonprofit. That adds up to an estimated $38 billion in lost labor. To remedy this situation, nonprofit leaders must develop a more strategic approach to managing this overlooked and undervalued talent pool. The good news is that new waves of retiring baby boomers and energetic young people are ready to fill the gap....",

        "content":"What would we do without Bruce Hopkins? This Kansas City-based attorney has so many books on nonprofits and the law to his credit that one might worry about his law practice. The list of in-print titles includes The Legal Answer Book for Private Foundations, The Tax Law of Charitable Giving, The First Legal Answer Book for Fund-Raisers, The Second Legal Answer Book for Fund-Raisers, The Legal Answer Book for Nonprofit Organizations, The Second Legal Answer Book for Nonprofit Organizations, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations, Charity, Advocacy and the Law, The Nonprofit Law Dictionary, and Starting and Managing A Nonprofit Organization, along with several other titles he writes with Jody Blazek as co-author.\n\nNow we have his third edition of The Law of Fundraising. As he notes in the introduction, the material here is essential for fundraisers to know about, but also becoming increasingly complex. Perusing the contents quickly, one cannot help but wonder if very many in the development profession feel comfortable approaching this complicated subject. And that is exactly why Hopkins' contributions to the field are so vital. He is a master at presenting legal issues to laypersons and helping them to understand the law  and the context in which the law has evolved over time.\n\nThe scope of the book is broad, encompassing the origins of governmental regulation, state laws, federal laws, emerging issues in governmental oversight, and standards in use by watchdog groups. Is fundraising a form of free speech? (Section 4.3) What is \"reasonable\" fundraising cost? (Section 4.1) How have various courts looked at compensation arrangements for fundraising professionals? (Section 5.13) How has the term \"professional fundraiser\" been defined by the legal system? (Section 3.2) A very practical section explains how nonprofits can cope with all the regulation governing their field, and how best to work out procedures for complying with the law. (Section 2.8).\n\nSome legal determinants are state or federal regulations, some are court decisions, and some are still open to interpretation. To help the reader understand how all the pieces fit together, the first appendix explains the various sources of the law. Subsequent appendices include copies of IRS Form 1023 (application for tax-exemption) and Form 990 (information return). A table of cases and an excellent index complete the volume. The text is footnoted throughout with case citations and other comments. As with earlier editions, it will be updated with annual cumulative supplements.\n\nHopkins is candid in his assessment that state regulation of fundraising has become confusing and burdensome, and he offers some remedies. He also makes the prediction that the pace of regulation will increase. In Section 7.15 he makes recommendations for the profession in dealing with this reality. Despite the fact that many in the nonprofit sector are not entirely comfortable delving into legal issues, Hopkins' approach takes the sting out of a thorny subject.\n\nFor additional citations on this topic, refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject headings \"Fundraising  law and legislation\" or \"State laws regulating charitable solicitation\".\n\nThe third edition of The Law of Fundraising, which covers the origins of governmental regulation, state laws, federal laws, emerging issues in governmental oversight, and standards in use by watchdog groups  material that is essential for fundraisers to know about, but also is becoming increasingly complex....",

        "title":"The People's IPO",
        "content":"\"Every time I go to Market Creek with my kids now, they say 'We own this,'\" says Bevelynn Bravo, a mother of four who lives in a struggling San Diego neighborhood known as the Diamond. Bravo recently took part in a first-of-its-kind initial public offering (IPO), purchasing 25 shares in the Market Creek shopping center at $10 per share. Market Creek Plaza's developer, the Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation (a foundation), had previously partnered with teams of residents to conceive, design, and plan the new shopping center. Now the foundation is pioneering what it calls a \"community development IPO\" to meet residents' new request  a chance to own a piece of Market Creek Plaza.\n\nMost IPOs target high-net-worth people. This one is aimed at area residents whose median income is $35,000. The IPO opened in July and will close at the end of December. Market Creek Partners will sell shares to 450 people who live, work, or volunteer in the Diamond. Investors need only $2,000 in net worth or annual income and can invest from $200 to $10,000.\n\nAs a group, these resident shareholders can claim up to a 20 percent stake in the company. The Jacobs Center will own 60 percent of the company, and the Neighborhood Unity Foundation will own the remaining 20 percent. By 2017, the Jacobs Center plans to retire its shares so that Market Creek will be completely owned by residents and the Unity Foundation, which residents control. Until that time, community residents will be first in line for any profits. Resident investors will also each have one vote  regardless of how little or much they invested  to elect a nine-person advisory board.\n\n\"Jacobs is showing that you can do commercial development and have community stakeholders be owners,\" says Heather McCulloch, principal of Asset Building Strategies and author of Building Assets While Building Communities. \"People have been talking about building community ownership since the sixties, and Jacobs actually did it.\"\n\nCreating a new kind of IPO wasn't easy, however. Neither was educating people who've never invested before. But community groups and foundations across the country are closely watching this IPO, wondering if something similar would work in their communities.\n\nA Rainbow at Death's Corner\n\nThe Jacobs Center and many of the Diamond's 80,000 residents want more than financial returns from the IPO. They hope it will spur residents to control how their neighborhood develops. The idea came about after residents inventoried neighborhood properties and realized that outsiders owned the most neglected ones. The Jacobs Center first worked with residents to determine the mix of stores they would like in Market Creek Plaza, which sits at an intersection previously known as the \"Four Corners of Death.\" Residents called for a grocery store, coffee shop, bank, and even an outdoor amphitheater that seats 500. They chose a brightly painted rainbow exterior, accented with portraits of neighborhood leaders and tile mosaics, all by local artists.\n\nResidents now hold 60 percent of the jobs. So far, most of the stores are reaching or exceeding their sales targets.\n\nHaving taken a piece of blighted land and partnered with residents to turn it into something valuable, the Jacobs Foundation wanted to \"recycle it back to the people who live there,\" says Jennifer Vanica, the foundation's CEO. But the mechanisms to conduct an IPO restricted to community residents didn't exist. Vanica and the residents weren't dissuaded. \"You get the biggest innovation when you work around obstacles,\" she says  of which there were no shortages. Over a five-year period, a team of 125 Diamond residents, Jacobs Center staff, and lawyers submitted 35 drafts of the IPO to the California Department of Corporations. At first, the department claimed the IPO was too risky for the community investors because Market Creek Plaza wasn't yet completed or fully leased.\n\nTwo years later, after the shopping center was built and stocked with vendors, the department again denied the IPO proposal  this time because some of the riskier ventures, such as allowing community entrepreneurs to open restaurants and stores, dampened the property's value.\n\nThe Jacobs team added additional properties, but the department still rejected its application. The IPO's targeted investors  Diamond residents  didn't meet the department's \"sophisticated investor\" test, which usually means having an income of $200,000, according to Vanica. Residents countered that the state would let them buy any amount of lottery tickets, which have a much lower probability of return. Eventually the department agreed on what Vanica calls the \"10-10-10\" rule: Residents would be able to invest up to 10 percent of their income, or 10 percent of their net worth, for up to $10,000.\n\nEducating Investors\n\nOnce the IPO was approved, Jacobs staff members and resident-partners had to educate first-time investors about investing in commercial real estate. The team first turned the 200-page Market Creek prospectus into a 20-page illustrated executive summary. Pictures and graphs answer questions such as \"What is equity?\" and \"How does the payout work?\"\n\nThe team then made sales pitches to residents who had been prescreened for eligibility to participate in the IPO. The pitches included a tour of Market Creek Plaza, dinner, and a 90-minute interactive presentation. So far, 85 percent of the residents who have attended the pitches have decided to become investors. More than 750 people are interested in investing. To date, people have invested an average of $1,000. Half have invested less than $500, which suggests that the Jacobs Center is meeting its goal of making half of the resident-owners first-time investors.\n\nIn mid-September, Jacobs launched a final push to attract neighborhood investors with billboards and buttons that say \"Are you in?\" A resident came up with the slogan.\n\nPatience and Time\n\nNearly 1,000 community groups and investors have toured Market Creek Plaza. Many ask whether Jacobs' community engagement and ownership mechanisms are too labor-intensive and expensive for other community groups and foundations. Victor Rubin doesn't think so. Rubin is the director of research at PolicyLink, which is evaluating the IPO. \"Involving residents in the design and planning doesn't take deep pockets,\" said Rubin. \"It just takes patience and time.\"\n\nThe Jacobs Center originally bought the 20-acre Market Creek Plaza for $4 million in 1998. At one point, Jacobs had borrowed $30 million against its portfolio to develop the plaza. They've since taken out a $15 million, 3 percent loan made possible by New Markets Tax Credits, which were introduced by the federal government in 2000 to spur economic development in lower-income communities.\n\nOther foundations are trying to follow the Jacobs model. The Casey Foundation, for instance, plans to develop 32 acres in a low-income community in Atlanta. Gail Hayes, Casey's Atlanta civic site coordinator, says: \"We don't have a vision for the property. We're going to ask the residents what their vision is.\" The organization is still considering whether to offer a community development IPO.\n\nMarket Creek Plaza isn't out of the high-risk phase, however. \"We are still learning about how to convert people to shop in their own neighborhood, and how to bring the rest of San Diego to Market Creek Plaza,\" says Vanica. Although residents could end up losing money on their investments, Jacobs absorbed the biggest risks before it invited in community investors.\n\nTo Bravo, the risks seem worthwhile. \"It was hard to give up $200 and not spend it at Wal-Mart,\" she says. \"But now I have something to leave my kids besides memories.\"\n\nCopyright 2007Stanford Social Innovation Review.

        "title":"Partners for the Planet",
        "content":"You know the world is changing when the largest corporate buy-out in history hinges on an environmental commitment. That's what happened in February when two top private equity firms enlisted the help of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit that finds practical solutions to environmental problems, to acquire TXU Corp., the largest utility in Texas, for $45 billion.\n\nLast year, TXU announced an alarming plan to build eleven old-fashioned, coal-burning power plants in the Lone Star State. These inefficient plants would have spewed seventy-eight million tons of carbon dioxide annually  more than the emissions of twenty-one states combined.\n\nNot wanting to be saddled with those environmental dinosaurs, the new buyers, Texas Pacific Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., worked with Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop an unprecedented plan for turning TXU around. They agreed to cancel eight of the planned plants and instead to invest $400 million to boost energy efficiency and explore environmentally friendlier coal technologies. They also pledged to join the United States Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), which supports a mandatory national cap on carbon emissions.\n\nThis marks the first time an environmental organization has partnered with a financial group to change the terms of a buyout. \"Every college activist should study this story, because it is the future,\" wrote Thomas Friedman in the New York Times.\n\nThe turnaround of TXU may be groundbreaking, but it's business as usual for Environmental Defense, where I serve as executive vice president. Over the past seventeen years we have learned that successful partnerships flow from three steps: identifying leaders, pointing out how environmentally sound practices will help them with their own aims, and setting aggressive, yet attainable goals.\n\nGet in Front of the Pack\n\nIt all started with a Styrofoam clamshell burger box. In 1990, Environmental Defense partnered with McDonald's to cut the fast-food giant's trash. Other environmental groups criticized us at the time, but eventually they were won over by the results: the elimination of 300 million pounds of unnecessary packaging, including foam-plastic sandwich boxes. In another partnership with McDonald's, we called on the company's meat suppliers to protect antibiotics for human medicine by curbing their use in farm animals for non-medicinal purposes. Four of the nation's top poultry producers soon reported ending this practice as well.\n\nFrom this experience we learned to target market leaders  like McDonald's  that value innovation. People often ask why we work with individual companies more than with trade organizations. The reason is that trade associations represent the pack. Leadership means stepping out in front of the pack. Working with trendsetters gives us maximum leverage, because the changes they make ripple through their supply chains and cause competitors to follow suit.\n\nBuilding on that model, we approached shipping leader FedEx Corp. in March 2000 with the idea of working together to develop a cleaner, more efficient delivery truck. FedEx was intrigued. Here was an idea that could cut unhealthy air pollution and save them money. Within a year, Environmental Defense and FedEx jointly launched the Future Vehicle Project and set ambitious fuel economy and pollution-reduction targets. Without dictating any particular technology, the partners invited proposals from truck manufacturers; they chose Eaton Corp.'s design for a diesel-electric hybrid.\n\nSoon Eaton, FedEx, and Environmental Defense were meeting regularly. By 2005, the project had put hybrid trucks to work in four test markets. The new trucks go 57 percent farther on a gallon of fuel and reduce disease-causing particulates by 96 percent. Their success inspired companies from Frito-Lay to Florida Power & Light Co. to test and buy hybrid trucks, and Environmental Defense is working with other big fleets to do the same.\n\nFind the Upside\n\nOur second technique for building successful alliances is crafting projects with an upside for our partners. Otherwise the companies might not sustain their environmental improvements. Upside benefits may come in the form of cost reductions, risk management, shareholder value, and new markets. TXU's buyers, for example, are avoiding expensive lawsuits that could have put the plants in limbo for years. And FedEx stands to cut its fuel costs by nearly 50 percent over time.\n\nTo understand how environmentally sound practices could help Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Environmental Defense opened a satellite office near the company's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.  just like all of the company's major partners. Serving 175 million customers a week and coordinating some 60,000 suppliers, the world's largest retailer has a huge impact. Wal-Mart CEO H. Lee Scott has set similarly outsized goals, including doubling vehicle fuel efficiency over the next decade and constructing new stores that are 25 percent to 30 percent more energy efficient. Scott estimates that the early savings from what he describes as this \"low-hanging fruit\" can be as much as $350 million per year.\n\nFor example, Wal-Mart buyers are looking to cut packaging by 5 percent across the board in five years. Wal-Mart is also experimenting with a simple change in the packaging of a private-label toy, which will save five thousand trees and thirteen hundred barrels of oil annually. The company says these measures could result in savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWal-Mart has also launched a program to purchase fish certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. This shot across the bow of the fishing industry caused many fishermen who had never heard of certification to ask what it is and what they have to do to get it. And Wal-Mart wins, too, because responding to consumer awareness builds consumer loyalty for their brand  which in Wal-Mart's case needs some burnishing.\n\nOf course, teaming up with Wal-Mart has risks all its own. We are well aware of the company's issues with health care, land use, labor practices, and employee benefits. Although our focus is on the environment, we are hopeful that success in one arena can help open the doors to other social benefits.\n\nAim High\n\nA final strategy in Environmental Defense's arsenal is to use our expertise to set aggressive yet attainable goals. This sounds obvious, but it's not so simple. One secret of attaining aggressive goals is to stay \"technology neutral\": With FedEx, we told truck manufacturers what we wanted in environmental performance, but not how to achieve the desired gains. That freed the competing suppliers to use their ingenuity to deliver results.\n\nAnother way to aim high is to blend corporate collaborations with appropriate governmental regulations. Partnerships with corporations are a powerful tool, but they alone are not sufficient to protect the planet. Governments must set strong policies that create for companies the right incentives for action. On no issue is this more important than with global warming, which presents American businesses with a big challenge and a big opportunity.\n\nRecognizing this, we launched USCAP, our groundbreaking alliance with ten of America's largest corporations. These companies have joined with us and other nonprofits in calling on Congress to pass a market-based cap on global warming pollution. USCAP would reduce U.S. emissions by 10 percent to 30 percent over the next fifteen years. That target is similar to the goal California set in 2006 in landmark climate change legislation, which Environmental Defense co-authored. Not long ago, the notion of businesses asking the federal government for a strict limit on emissions would have been unthinkable. But a growing number of Fortune 500 companies  from Alcoa Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. to Duke Energy Corp. and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  understand the need for decisive action. It's not just altruism that drives them; they crave certainty. They want to know what the rules of the game will be so they can plan their future strategy. Add to that savings from efficiency and increased revenues from satisfied, loyal consumers and you can see why smart companies realize that green business is good business.\n\nUltimately, when you ask people to do things differently, they have to trust you and know what you stand for. The environment is not a special interest, it's a public interest. And partnerships like these are milestones on the road to a new brand of environmental advocacy.\n\nDavid Yarnold is responsible for all operations at Environmental Defense, a $75 million per year NGO.

        "title":"The Responsibility Paradox",
        "content":"In early 2007, thousands of cats and dogs in North America fell ill with kidney ailments. Many of the pets had dined on kibble made by chez Menu Foods Inc., a company in Ontario, Canada, that manufactures pet foods for more than 100 brands, including Procter & Gamble, Iams, Colgate-Palmolive's Science Diet, and Wal-Mart's Ol' Roy. By mid-April, investigators had traced the animals' illnesses to melamine, an industrial chemical that tainted a few of Menu Foods' raw ingredients. They then followed the thread to two suppliers in China, which had spiked the ingredients to cut costs and boost profits.\n\nSo where should the public point its finger? Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Wal-Mart, and the many other corporations that own the pet food brands? Menu Foods, which mixed the kibble? The Chinese manufacturers, which adulterated the ingredients? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which failed to detect anything amiss? The stores that didn't remove the foods from the shelves, even after Menu Foods recalled them?\n\nTraditional notions of corporate social responsibility say that companies are beholden to the communities in which they are located. But globalization has made it difficult to discern exactly which communities to include. With far-flung value chains, decentralized governance, and churning employees, multinational corporations have become what British journalist Martin Wolf calls \"rootless cosmopolitans.\"\n\nBefore it went private in 2006, for example, Tommy Hilfiger had its corporate headquarters in Hong Kong, its legal incorporation in the British Virgin Islands, its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, its annual meeting in Bermuda, and most of its manufacturing in Mexico and Asia. Likewise, Royal Caribbean International has its headquarters in Miami; registers its ships in the Bahamas, Malta, and Ecuador; and is legally incorporated in Liberia, where it is subject to neither Liberian nor U.S. income taxes. The Liberian corporate registry, in turn, is a business housed in a nondescript office park near Washington Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia.\n\nWhat does Tommy Hilfiger owe to Hong Kong, Bermuda, New York, and Mexico  not to mention to the countless malls where its goods are sold? What are Royal Caribbean's responsibilities to Liberia, which few of its executives could locate on a map?\n\nAlthough firms have changed drastically with globalization, their understandings of corporate social responsibility have not kept pace. This presents corporations with a paradox: At a time when more stakeholders than ever are calling them to account, firms have but a foggy notion of what, exactly, their obligations are.\n\nWe propose an updated notion of corporate social responsibility  global corporate social responsibility  that reflects the fact that people hold firms responsible for actions far beyond their boundaries, including the actions of suppliers, distributors, alliance partners, and even sovereign nations. Our research suggests that the standards for global CSR will be just as international as corporations themselves: the European Union will set the tone for product and environmental standards, the United States will largely shape governance guidelines, and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will drive human rights and labor rules.\n\nThe Firm Evolves\n\nThe multinational corporation of the 21st century bears little resemblance to its forebears. In the 1950s and 1960s, U.S.- based corporations aimed for continuous growth in revenues and employment, which they often brought about through mergers and acquisitions. Employees of large American firms viewed their jobs as lifetime commitments, with regular raises and generous benefits upon retirement. Most large corporations had widely dispersed ownership, and so shareholders  mostly individuals  were relatively powerless.\n\nBy the early 1980s, however, two sets of changes eroded the sharp separation of corporate ownership and control that had characterized American-style capitalism for at least half a century. First, individuals began putting their savings into mutual funds rather than into savings accounts. Consequently, institutional investors began replacing individual investors as the direct owners of the nation's largest public companies. As institutional investors increased their ownership of corporate America, they exercised their new power by wringing better performance from companies  particularly the poorly performing manufacturing behemoths that had been assembled over the previous two decades.\n\nSecond, the Reagan administration relaxed its antitrust standards, and several court decisions facilitated hostile takeovers. As a result, a wave of buyouts and takeovers dissolved many of the conglomerates that had started the decade. To cut costs, corporations focused on a narrower range of activities, outsourcing and off-shoring many of their processes. And it wasn't only the rank-and-file employees who saw their jobs go to temporary employees and contract business services: Executives also received pink slips when their companies' earnings disappointed or stock prices sagged.\n\nMeanwhile, globalization, international economic deregulation, and new information and communications technologies intensified competition between corporations. American firms watched their profit margins decline decade by decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. To cut costs and increase profits, corporations amped up their outsourcing and downsizing throughout the '90s, aided by technological advances. Firms like General Motors and Ford, which once viewed their vertical integration as a source of strength, spun off new companies to manufacture their parts and components, thereby unburdening themselves of costly union labor. Following a model pioneered by Nike, companies like Sara Lee sold off nearly all their manufacturing plants and became, in essence, \"virtual\" manufacturers, taking charge of design, marketing, and distribution but outsourcing the actual manufacturing to suppliers. Indeed, by the turn of the century, a number of large \"manufacturing\" firms were in fact manufacturing nothing at all.\n\nAt the same time, the actual manufacturers began handling production for many different companies. Ingram Micro, for instance, assembled personal computers for four of the five largest PC manufacturers on the same assembly lines in the 1990s. And the Canadian factory responsible for the tainted pet food of summer 2007 was cooking kibble for more than 100 brands.\n\nWell into the 21st century, corporations continue adding more links to their supply chains, stretching ever farther across the globe for cheaper materials and labor. Consequently, consumers can no longer unambiguously define a car as \"American\" or a tool as \"Japanese\" when their raw materials, production, and assembly often take place in several different countries. Indeed, by 2003, nearly half of the United States' total imports reflected transactions between different parts of a single firm rather than arm's-length sales to final consumers, according to the A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index.\n\nCorporations Take Responsibility\n\nThis blurring of corporations' institutional and national boundaries has complicated the question of what their responsibilities are. Is the corporation simply a nexus of contracts, with \"no soul to damn, no body to kick,\" as Baron Thurlow, lord chancellor of England in the late 18th century, is quoted as saying, 4 and therefore responsible only to its shareholders? Or is the modern multinational corporation, with its global reach in both production and sales, a social being with responsibilities to all its stakeholders  employees, customers, shareholders, creditors, suppliers, communities, even society as a whole? And if so, what are the scope and limits of these responsibilities?\n\nHistory has favored the latter interpretation. Corporate social responsibility  meaning the voluntary actions a corporation takes to improve the lot of its various stakeholders  is a relatively recent term. But firms have practiced CSR almost from the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 18th century, for example, factory owners had to provide both physical and social infrastructure  everything from roads, canals, and housing to worker education and health care  to support large-scale manufacturing.\n\nWell into the late 19th century, owners still provided housing and community services, both out of beneficence and out of the desire to control and discipline their workers. As noted by one observer of Pullman, Ill., the company town created for workers who manufactured Pullman railroad cars: \"It is benevolent, well-wishing feudalism, which desires the happiness of the people, but in such way as shall please the authorities.\" (In 1894, \"pleasing the authorities\" apparently fell out of favor when Pullman became the site of one of the most brutal labor disputes in U.S. history.) Company towns still feature prominently in some developing economies. For example, the Tata conglomerate in India continues to operate the town of Jamshedpur on behalf of its steel manufacturing facility.\n\nThe great fortunes created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries inspired CSR that went beyond the communities where corporations were located. Andrew Carnegie, for instance, funded public libraries across the country, far from the origins of his steel fortune. Carnegie also started TIAA, which became the major vehicle for academic faculty pension support in the United States.\n\nBy the early part of the 20th century, corporate-sponsored welfare capitalism provided employees with health care, pensions, and many other services Europeans would increasingly consider to be the province of the state. During the post-World War II era, however, Americans began to debate how much responsibility corporations should assume beyond their own boundaries. On the one hand, as the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in Dodge v. Ford Motor Company in 1919 plainly stated, corporations could not justify expenditures for anything other than improving profits: \"A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end.\"\n\nOn the other hand, commentators such as economist Carl Kaysen noted that the modern corporation is \"the single strongest social force shaping its career members,\" and that it should strive to be \"soulful.\" \"No longer the agent of proprietorship seeking to maximize return on investment,\" Kaysen wrote of the soulful corporation, \"management sees itself as responsible to stockholders, employees, customers, the general public, and, perhaps most important, the firm itself as an institution.\"\n\nThe Three Sectors Collide\n\nWhile corporate executives debated how much social responsibility they should voluntarily assume, the U.S. federal government  often at the urging of domestic NGOs  began codifying what had been the corporation's spontaneous beneficence. Thus the three sectors began their delicate dance over which obligations corporations must fulfill and which they can ignore. For instance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 aimed to reduce discrimination on the job, to create safer products and workplaces, and to improve environmental quality.\n\nAs production and markets shipped overseas, so too did efforts to hold corporations accountable for their actions. NGOs went international, and international lawmaking bodies went into the business of regulating business. In 1977, for example, European NGOs banded together to protest Nestl's marketing of infant formula to low-income nations of the global south. The Infant Formula Action Coalition (INFACT) argued that Nestl's marketing efforts were unethical: Mother's milk is more healthful than formula, and consumers often used unclean or too much water to mix the formula, resulting in disease and malnutrition for their infants. Nestl's inaction in response to INFACT prompted the latter to call for an international boycott of Nestl. By 1981, the boycott had resulted in U.S. Senate hearings and the development of a UNICEF/World Health Organization code that prohibited the advertising, promotion, and provision of samples of infant formula. The boycott ended in 1984, when Nestl agreed to abide by the new code. The Nestl boycott became a model for subsequent global consumer boycotts.\n\nIn the 1990s, international NGOs and lawmaking bodies began holding corporations responsible not only for their own behavior, but also for the behavior of their suppliers. Nike was one of the first corporations to discover that its legal boundaries no longer set the limits of its responsibilities. In a highly publicized campaign, a number of NGOs alleged that the apparel giant's suppliers in Southeast Asia violated labor rights. More recently, several plaintiff groups have used the Alien Tort Claims Act to sue American firms in American courts for allegedly helping foreign governments violate human rights. The case against Unocal in Myanmar was settled out of court, and the case against ExxonMobil in Nigeria is still in litigation (see \"Getting Human Rights Right\" on p. 54 for more on these cases).\n\nTo stave off further outside regulation, a growing number of American firms are attempting to regulate themselves. As early as 1972, when GM published its first public interest report, corporations began to study and report on their own practices. By 2005, 52 percent of the Fortune Global 250 firms produced corporate responsibility reports. And the growing demand for third-party monitoring has ushered in a long and growing list of monitoring organizations and processes. Some of these monitoring efforts are partnerships between firms, NGOs, and, in some cases, governments. Others fall strictly under the control of one group, often creating mutual antagonism and suspicion.\n\nBut figuring out how to deal with the expanding boundaries of corporate social responsibility remains very much a work in progress. Our research gives some hints on whence corporations should take their cues. Traditionally, corporations have followed the standards set by local and national regulators and stakeholder groups. But successful multinational corporations will soon have to look beyond national boundaries to discover which standards to follow, and perhaps to exceed.\n\nEurope Pushes Product Safety\n\nWhen it comes to product safety and environmental standards, corporations should look to the European Union for the shape of things to come. With the recent addition of 10 new members, the European Union's 25 nations together constitute the world's largest market  surpassing the United States. Non-E.U. companies that compete in the global marketplace, or hope to do so, must therefore design and manufacture their products to conform to E.U. requirements. This is because customizing products to meet different rules and standards in different countries vastly increases complexity and expense.\n\nBecause the European Union's environmental and product safety standards tend to be the strictest, the race for lowest production costs will ironically spur the adoption of more responsible processes and products. In the past, firms often chased the lowest-cost labor forces housed in the most lax regulatory environments, thus inducing states to provide a docile labor force and to turn a blind eye to pollution. But the European Union strongly abides by the precautionary principle, which holds that, in cases where the likelihood of harm is unknown, rules and standards should err on the side of caution.\n\nThe European Union's precautionary principle has not always prevailed in cases brought before the World Trade Organization. But its success in creating de facto global law is impressive. As Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, put it: \"Europe in many ways is the global regulatory superpower. It can speak with one voice and a degree of certainty.\"\n\nFor example, the European Union's 2006 ban on lead, cadmium, and mercury in electronic products is forcing the electronics industry to eradicate these heavy metals from their supply chains, affecting thousands of firms around the world. Similarly, European cradle-to-grave standards, which require producers to recycle their own products, led U.S.-based Dell to design more easily disassembled computers. Dell now also offers free computer pickup and recycling in both the European Union and the United States.\n\nPerhaps the greatest impact of the European Union's precautionary principle is on farmers, primarily but not exclusively American, who grow genetically modified crops. The European Union has stringent restrictions on genetically altered foods. Fearing marketing problems in the European Union, multinational food processors increasingly refuse to buy genetically modified crops. The global reach of such decisions is broad: Food-scarce African nations allegedly avoid planting higher-yield genetically modified seeds because they fear that they cannot export the resulting crops to E.U. countries.\n\nEuropean pressures also influence the processes involved in international commerce. For instance, over the past few years, some 200 U.S. companies, including Microsoft, have signed agreements to abide by E.U. Internet privacy rules. These rules affect the transfer and use of online data, and thus virtually every firm that has workers, suppliers, or customers within the European Union.\n\nThe European Union has also raised environmental standards. When the United States announced that it would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, the European Union built a consensus among enough countries to ratify the treaty. As a result, companies are adopting the protocol's standards, even though the United States did not sign it. In fact, though, most E.U. countries are not meeting their emissions-reduction benchmarks. This failure has led its critics to argue that the overall goals set for 2012 are unlikely to be met. Furthermore, they note that as long as such large, fast-growing countries as China and India are under no similar obligations, even successful progress toward the protocol's targets would not prevent a substantial increase in global CO2 emissions. More generally, critics of the European Union's strict product standards argue that, in a number of cases, they are unnecessarily costly and without scientific basis.\n\nThe United States Guides Governance\n\nAlthough product and environmental regulations will reflect European standards, corporate governance will reflect an American-style orientation to transparency, consistent profitability, and shareholder protection. When companies list their shares in the United States, they must meet all the rules of the market on which they are listed, as well as U.S. securities regulations. Because the quest for capital and industry dominance is leading global corporations to list their shares in the United States, American standards have become international standards for capital markets.\n\nBy 2005, all but two of the world's 25 largest corporations were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the exceptions are Germany's Volkswagen and France's Carrefour). Indeed, more foreign firms were listed on U.S. markets than German firms were listed on the Deutsche Brse. Although anecdotal evidence says that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's rigorous demands may have slowed this process, and may even lead some foreign firms to delist, so far there has been more grumbling than action, and relatively few firms have defected.\n\nThe consequences of not complying with American securities rules and regulations can be dire. For example, in 2004, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group paid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) $120 million in penalties to settle charges that the firm had inflated its reported oil reserves. And then in 2006, the owner and top executive of Mexico's U.S.-traded TV Azteca paid $7.5 million to settle fraud charges. In both cases, the SEC was far more aggressive than home-country regulators in its pursuit of fraud charges.\n\nAt the same time, foreign funders are pressing other industrialized nations to pay more attention to governance, accountability, and profitability. By 2000, for example, Americans owned roughly $1 trillion in European equities. Institutions such as TIAA-CREF and Fidelity used their new clout to intervene in matters traditionally left to management. TIAA-CREF, for instance, stepped in to prevent Telecom Italia's plan to spin off its wireless unit, and Fidelity publicly opposed the same firm's proposed merger with Olivetti.\n\nIn addition, foreign pension funds, mutual funds, and other intermediaries have begun to emulate the shareholder activism of their American counterparts. For example, Jang Ha Sung, the dean of the Korea University business school, has sought to improve the governance of opaque, family-dominated South Korean firms for more than a decade. His group, People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, convinced SK Telecom to create an independent audit committee and Samsung Electronics to make its accounting more transparent. Through his current work with Lazard's $280 million Korea Cor porate Governance Fund, he hopes to reduce the \"Korea discount\"  the undervaluation of Korean stocks relative to those in other Asian nations, which Jang attributes to poor corporate governance.\n\nOne result of the global spread of profitability pressures is that the American boardroom revolution of the 1990s appears to be going global. A study of the world's 2,500 largest listed companies by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton revealed that the number of chief executives dismissed worldwide rose significantly in 2002, increasing from 2.3 percent in 2001 to 3.9 percent in 2002, as compared with only 1 percent in 1995. Board and shareholder impatience with poor financial performance underlay these dismissals: Companies that dismissed their CEOs generated 6.2 percentage points lower total shareholder returns than did companies whose CEOs retired voluntarily.\n\nShareholder-oriented governance can bring its own issues. The corporate scandals that inspired Sarbanes-Oxley, and the more recent imbroglios about stock options at dozens of U.S. companies, show that commitment to shareholder value can have unintended consequences. Moreover, emphasis on shareholder value sometimes translates into a short-term orientation that puts companies at odds with other emerging global standards. This is yet another reason why both firms and financial analysts should shift their focus toward longer-term viability and profitability.\n\nNGOs Head Human Rights\n\nAs globalization increases, international and indigenous NGOs are developing their presences in low-income countries and demanding changes in corporate policies. These demands can not only disrupt local production, but also sully the reputations of corporations in their home countries. For example, in the early 1990s, the Ogoni people of Nigeria began a series of protests against Shell and Nigerian National Petroleum. Shell's environmental impact on the Ogoni, coupled with its lack of economic impact, prompted large-scale protests at Shell facilities in 1993. In response, the Nigerian military destroyed more than three dozen villages and executed nine Ogoni protest leaders. Global social movements supported the Ogoni by launching an international boycott and a shareholder campaign against the oil giant.\n\nA number of NGOs and freelance activists have also mounted an international antiglobalization movement. Believing that transnational trade agreements benefit multinational corporations to the detriment of ordinary working people, the poor, and the environment, these activists kicked off the antiglobalization movement in 2000 with their disruptive demonstrations against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. Since that time, they have regularly protested other international financial and trade arrangements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2004. Although these protestors seem united in a single global justice movement, they are in fact transient teams of activists from a number of disparate movements. Despite its ragtag origins, the antiglobalization movement has forced global issues onto both corporate and public agendas. For example, NGOs have put pressure on a number of multinational consumer goods producers, beginning with Nike, to take responsibility not only for their own behavior regarding workers' rights, but also for the behavior of their globally dispersed suppliers.\n\nTo respond to heightened human rights standards, managers and executives must not only respond in a forthright matter to the complaints of local residents and NGOs; they must also develop a systematic way of thinking about the possible impacts of the corporation on local populations. Some corporations have joined international certifying agencies that measure compliance with voluntary standards. Others are learning on their own  and sometimes the hard way  how to mitigate possible damages from their operations.\n\nRegulation Begets Responsibility\n\nWhat we now call corporate social responsibility evolved out of practices that companies developed for clear business purposes during industrialization. Contemporary multinational corporations are vastly different from their predecessors, and so are the standards that they are expected to meet. For the future of global CSR, we suggest that corporations look to the European Union for product safety and environmental standards, to the United States for corporate governance guidelines, and to international NGOs for human and labor rights rules.\n\nCritics of the regulation of corporate activities fear that regulation will ultimately undercut the realization of social goals. For example, T.J. Rodgers, CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, responded to the Clinton administration's efforts to induce more corporate good works with an op-ed in The New York Times (April 29, 1997): \"When good works cease to be voluntary and become compulsory, charity becomes confiscation and freedom becomes servitude. Philanthropy is a byproduct of wealth, and wealth is best created in free markets whose workings embody a fundamental and true moral principle long forgotten in Washington.\"\n\nWe disagree with Rodgers. Although the literature on CSR supplies plenty of anecdotal evidence of corporate altruism  for example, the oft-repeated story of Merck's development of its river blindness drug (see \"Sharing Power\" in the fall 2005 issue of the Stanford Social Innovation Review)  our research shows that regulation is the surer path to soulful corporate behavior. Using KLD Research & Analytics' annual ratings of several hundred public corporations, we find the following patterns: 1) the corporations most engaged with their communities, particularly through corporate philanthropy, are financial institutions whose contributions are effectively mandated by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977; 2) corporations with the best environmental records, which include petroleum refining, primary metals, rubber and plastic, and utilities, are those with the most contact with the Environmental Protection Agency; and 3) the industries with the best employment practices, which include metal extraction, airlines, petroleum refining, and transportation, are among the most heavily unionized.\n\nThis suggests that if we want multinationals to exceed standards of responsible behavior, then we need to understand how and where those standards are defined. It also means that, in the absence of such standards  regulation and other forms of organized social pressures  multinationals are unlikely to adopt best practices. The paradox of responsibility may paralyze them, rather than move them to action.\n\nCSR has been a contested concept, as many have argued that the responsibility of the corporation is solely to make a profit. Now and in the future, however, management that ignores its social responsibilities will always be behind the curve.\n\nThe authors thank the Center for Advancing Research and Solutions for Society at the University of Michigan for supporting this research.\n\nThe notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has not changed much over the years. As a result, just as stakeholders are holding corporations more responsible for their actions, corporations understand their responsibilities to stakeholders even less. To resolve this paradox, firms must update their CSR practices.",

        "title":"The Nonprofits of 2025",
        "content":"Like all institutions and organizations, nonprofits are shaped by political frameworks, policies, and programs. So if we ask what future nonprofits might look like  say, the nonprofits of 2025  we must review past and current trends. For several decades, most developed market economies have seen a general increase in the economic importance of nonprofit organizations as providers of health, social, educational, and cultural services. There also has been a new and renewed emphasis on the social and political roles of nonprofits, usually in the context of civil society, democracy building, and political participation. Indeed, these developments are taking place in many countries, and they are driven in large measure by four broad perspectives.\n\nFirst, nonprofits are increasingly part of new public management (NPM) approaches  what could be called a mixed economy of welfare  with a heavy reliance on quasi-markets and competitive bidding processes. Examples of this development include expanded contracting regimes in health and social service provision, many types of voucher programs, and public-private partnerships. In essence, this policy choice treats nonprofits as more efficient providers than public agencies and as more trustworthy than for-profit businesses in markets where monitoring is costly and profiteering likely.\n\nSecond, nonprofits are seen as central to building and rebuilding civil society and strengthening the nexus between social capital and economic development. With the social fabric changing, civic associations of many kinds seem to be the glue holding diverse societies together. The basic assumption is that people embedded in dense networks of associational bonds are not only less prone to social problems but also economically more productive and politically more involved.\n\nThird, nonprofits are crucial to social accountability. They are increasingly viewed as instruments of greater transparency and heightened accountability for improving governance of public institutions and businesses. Accountability mechanisms include citizen advisory boards, community councils, participatory budgeting, public expenditure tracking, monitoring of public service delivery, and consumer protection. The underlying premise is that conventional accountability enforcement mechanisms such as elections, public oversight agencies, and the media are falling short; nonprofits are to become the social whistleblowers and advocates for voices that would otherwise remain unheard.\n\nFourth, nonprofits are seen as a source of innovation in solving social problems. Indeed, nonprofits are assumed to be better at social innovations than governments because their smaller scale and greater proximity to communities make them creative agents in finding solutions. Governments are encouraged to seek a new form of partnership with nonprofits aimed at identifying, vetting, and scaling up social innovations to build more flexible, less entrenched public responses.\n\nWhat do these perspectives mean for the nonprofit sector of the future? Assuming that the trends continue, the following scenarios may serve as markers that nonprofit representatives may wish to consider:\n\nNPM Scenario\n\nNonprofits become a set of well-organized quasi-corporate entities that take on the tasks and functions that previously were the purview of the state but that are now delivered through competitive bidding processes and contractual arrangements to maximize the competitive advantages of nonprofit providers in complex social markets. In the end, the nonprofit sector could become the private extension agent of a minimalist contract regime run by government.\n\nCivic Scenario\n\nNonprofits are the building blocks of a self-organizing and self-correcting community corpus. They are part of a benign civil society in which high levels of individualism and special interest coincide with equally high levels of participation, engagement, and connectivity. The nonprofit sector would form a set of interlocking associational complexes designed to prevent social ills and detect and correct them before they become \"social problems.\" In this scenario, nonprofits are the self-governing bedrock of civil society and are supported by philanthropy; they coordinate their own activities and exist at arm's length alongside a small technocratic state.\n\nAccountability Scenario\n\nNonprofits are a force of and for advocacy. As a source of dissent, and with independent philanthropic resources at their disposal, they challenge and protect  by building and moving political agendas and monitoring government and business. Indeed, they emerge as a countervailing force that serves as a social, cultural, and political watchdog keeping both market and state in check and accountable. The nonprofit sector creates and reflects the diversity, pluralism, and dynamism of modern society.\n\nInnovation Scenario\n\nNonprofits are encouraged to operate in problem fields that politicians find either too costly or inopportune to tackle themselves. Elected leaders can contend that \"something is being done.\" Nonprofits are the fig leaf for a political world unwilling to tackle social problems in a serious way. Attracting philanthropic venture capital, and integrated into social investment markets, nonprofits become the \"search engine\" for social problem-solving in modern societies.\n\nIt is, of course, unlikely that any of these four scenarios will prevail exclusively; more likely, one may become dominant, especially economically. In this respect, the NPM scenario will continue to shape the evolution of service-providing nonprofits. It will enable new for-profit/nonprofit hybrids to emerge, not only in the changing health and social care markets but also in fields where public contracting will become more prominent: education and research, environment, energy, and information technology.\n\nThe various scenarios outlined above not only cast the nonprofit sector in a different role, they also imply different roles for the government and business sector. At one level, nonprofits become parallel actors that may complement or even counteract state activities and compete with businesses, as in the NPM scenario. This perspective is very much in line with classical liberalism and is also present in the civil society and accountability scenarios. At another level, government and nonprofits are part of ever more complex public-private partnerships; they work in complementary fashion with other agencies, public and private.\n\nBoth scenarios are possible, as traditional notions of public benefit and public responsibilities shift from the state to other actors, paving the way for nonprofit organizations to be private actors for the public good. The role of the state as \"enabler\" and \"animator\" of private action for public service has increased and will continue to do so. This development, in turn, will continue to push and pull nonprofits in all the four directions  amounting, in the end, to a future positioning that is as contradictory as it is dynamic, and as unsettled as it is vital for society.\n\nHelmut K. Anheier is professor of sociology and dean at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. He also holds a chair of sociology at Heidelberg University and serves as academic director of its Center for Social Investment.\n\nIn the latest article in our SSIR series, the dean of Hertie School of Governance in Berlin considers four possible scenarios for how the vital role the nonprofit sector plays in society will evolve, along with changes in the business and government sectors....",

        "title":"The Cultural Touch",
        "content":"The waters surrounding Indonesia's Togean Islands are among the richest on Earth. For generations, fishermen have depended on these teeming reefs to support their families. One fish species, the electric-blue Napoleon wrasse, commands especially high prices from Asian diners. But practices like blast fishing  using dynamite to bring these big fish to the surface  destroy the coral reefs that sustain not only the Napoleon wrasse, but also the people who fish for them.\n\nSarilani Wirawan came to the Togean Islands in 2001 to teach villagers how to take better care of their marine environment. At first, families who were barely eking out an existence didn't want to hear about conservation, even from a fellow Indonesian. Unfazed, Wirawan, who has a degree in psychology, dressed in a giant Napoleon wrasse costume and visited the village schools. Children loved the mascot, as well as the puppet shows and songs that carried an environmental message. Their excitement followed them home, where they brought their parents into the conversation. Before long, entire villages were talking about the need to protect the reefs.\n\n\"Adults began to see me not as an outsider telling them what to do, but as someone facilitating the community to design its own solution,\" says Wirawan. Gradually, villagers understood that protecting the reefs would be in their own long-term interest. By the end of Wirawan's two-year campaign, the islanders agreed to protect traditional fishing sites from the use of dynamite and cyanide. Two years later, the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry declared almost 895,000 acres of the Togean Islands a national park. And an organization called Rare scored another quiet victory, demonstrating its ability to work the people side of the conservation equation.\n\nRare, a 35-year-old nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, has adapted to fill a special niche within the global conservation movement. Whereas many large environmental groups conduct grand conservation research projects, protect millions of acres, and shape the global conservation agenda, Rare waits for invitations from local communities, and then helps the people in those communities work out their own solutions. For Rare's low-key, person-centered, high-impact efforts, The Motley Fool called Rare \"one of the best charities you've never heard of.\" And Fast Company picked Rare for its Social Capitalist Award four years in a row  the only environmental organization to earn that distinction.\n\nRare now works in 40 countries  especially in the developing tropics, where human poverty and endangered natural riches are precariously intertwined. Its customized and time-intensive local programs have kept the organization small. But in a recent shift, Rare staked its future on expanding its signature Rare Pride program. With requests for new campaigns coming from all over the world, Rare is having a hard time keeping up with demand. This may be a good problem for businesses, but it's a bad problem for species teetering on the edge of extinction. As Rare has rapidly expanded its boutique programs, it has learned how to grow without destroying its unique niche in the world of conservation.\n\nA CONSERVATON COOKBOOK\n\nRare's most famous and successful program, Rare Pride, started with a parrot. Back in the 1970s, Paul Butler was a newly graduated English biologist looking for a place to put his training to work. He found it in St. Lucia, a small Caribbean island with a bird problem: the St. Lucia parrot was fast approaching extinction. Hunters captured the birds and sold them as exotic pets. And birds that escaped the hunters found less and less forest habitat to live in. Taking a species count, Butler found only 100 remaining parrots, submitted a dire report, and then took up the challenge of putting his written recommendations into practice.\n\nButler stayed in the area for 12 years, working as a conservation advisor to the St. Lucia Forestry Department. He soon figured out that he had to stop sounding like a scientist if he hoped to connect with rural islanders. And so he adapted Madison Avenue's methods. \"I realized that companies selling cigarettes or perfume sell their message in a different way than we were selling conservation,\" he explains. \"These companies are very successful at getting people to change behavior  even if it means buying a product that might kill them.\"\n\nBy comparison, he thought the conservation message should be an easy sell. After all, conservation has as much to do with human issues  clean water and renewable resources  as it does with biodiversity. \"We don't want to change people's behavior so that they starve and the parrot lives,\" Butler explains. \"We want people to change their own behavior so that the parrot lives and they live better.\"\n\nButler set out to market the bird as a symbol of this newly independent island nation. Before long, St. Lucia declared the parrot its national bird, set aside forest reserves, and harshly penalized hunters. Pop songs celebrated the parrot, and ministers praised it from their pulpits. Today, the St. Lucia parrot population \"has clawed its way back to 600 or 700,\" Butler estimates.\n\nAs the parrot story circulated, Butler's popularity soared. In the mid-1980s, a Rare board member met Butler during a chance visit to St. Lucia. At the time, Rare was known as the RARE Center for Tropical Bird Conservation, and concentrated on saving endangered birds in the Caribbean and Central America. Rare invited Butler to test his approach on a neighboring island with its own endangered parrot. Within a year, St. Vincent had passed new laws to protect its native parrot and to end the local custom of selling caged birds in markets.\n\nAPPEALING TO PRIDE\n\nMore requests followed from other islands in the Caribbean. At a third site, Butler taught a forestry staffer to lead the social marketing campaign. A replicable model began to take shape: choose a flagship species as an iconic mascot; build a multimedia marketing campaign around this mascot to gain grassroots support; remove barriers to change; and then convince people to change their behaviors so that conservation can succeed.\n\nRare Pride campaigns may look playful, but behind the fun are sophisticated social marketing techniques, which convince people to make changes for their own good. Campaigns use all sorts of vehicles  billboards, slogans, radio and TV spots, celebrity endorsements, cultural festivals  that are fine-tuned to their target audience. For years, public health officers have used social marketing techniques for everything from promoting seat belt use to discouraging smoking. Most recently, the \"We Can Solve It\" campaign, backed by Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection to the tune of $300 million, uses slick TV spots and celebrity faces to convince Americans to reverse global warming.\n\nIn Rare's case, the target audience tends to be rural and poor, and campaign methods are considerably less flashy. Butler says that his use of social marketing came about \"almost without thinking about it. We just wanted to get across a message that should be important to people.\" From his first campaign, he realized that he had tapped into a powerful resource: local pride. \"People recognized that this parrot is something that's very special, and it's ours. That changed the way the conversation went.\"\n\nButler captured lessons learned in a manual he now compares to \"a cookery book. The idea was we could send out this book instead of me. It seemed far more sustainable if you could find a local person to lead this rather than have me wandering across the Caribbean.\" Butler followed the book with personal visits, mentoring local campaign managers who typically worked for a small nonprofit or government agency. By the late 1990s, Rare Pride had completed thirty-three two-year campaigns around the world.\n\nGROWING GRASSROOTS LEADERS\n\nCentral to Rare Pride's early success was its ability to identify and train local leaders who could sell their fellow community members on the value of conservation. These grassroots activists didn't look much like traditional conservationists. With few exceptions, leaders of the recent conservation movement have been white male scientists, trained in the universities of North America and Europe. Having capable scientists at the helm \"has been great for developing the science of conservation biology,\" says Brett Jenks, president and CEO of Rare. But achieving lasting solutions on the ground requires changes in human behavior. And that calls for a different and more diverse profile.\n\n\"What leaders do is not universal. It's culturally adaptive,\" says Chet Tchozewski, executive director of the Global Greengrants Fund, a Boulder, Colo.-based nonprofit that makes small grants to support innovative environmental solutions in the developing world. \"There is not a prescribed design that we have mastered and can export.\" He says that people in rich nations \"need to trust indigenous leadership in these [developing] countries and not try to manipulate it into a Western style of leadership or management.\"\n\nIn Kenya, for example, \"the best candidate to lead a Rare Pride campaign might be a young guy they call a mini-elder,\" explains Jenks. \"He's going to be an elder in his time.\" In another community, it might be a woman who has led committees in her church or a radio DJ who is comfortable speaking to groups.\n\nSimilarly, environmental solutions often do not translate easily from one location to another. Convincing Ugandans to stop hunting bushmeat, for example, is a different challenge from convincing rural Mexicans to replace slash-and-burn agriculture with practices that will not destroy tropical forests and watersheds. Salvador Garca Ruvalcaba learned this in Mexico's Sierra de Manantln Biosphere Reserve, where he launched a Rare Pride campaign to reduce forest fires started by burning crop fields. He first used the Mexican trogon bird as a mascot, and then convinced farmers to learn better fire-management methods. But when he realized that local families were desperate for new income sources, he started a second campaign, which established the largest community-based recycling program in Mexico.\n\nTo cultivate local leaders, Rare turns to its partners: hundreds of tiny nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the developing tropics that focus on addressing local environmental issues. These grassroots organizations must be willing to lend a staff member to run the two-year Rare Pride campaign. The ideal candidate is from the community where the campaign will focus.\n\nOnce Rare is invited to work in a particular site and has a local campaign manager on board, Rare Pride kicks into gear. The campaign manager attends university-based training with a cohort of other managers who speak the same language. The curriculum is a mix of environmental science and people skills, including behavior change theory and social marketing methods. Managers also get a laptop, technical support, a hefty manual, access to a tool kit of field-tested marketing tools, and mentoring. But planning the actual campaign happens back in the community with the involvement of local stakeholders.\n\nWirawan, for instance, led the Togean Islands campaign through a Rare partnership with Conservation International (CI). Her psychology background made her an anomaly in CI's Indonesian office, where staffers tend to specialize in biology or ecology, but a natural for this assignment. Her formal training from Rare was intellectually taxing at times. \"I was ready to cry every time I heard the word 'taxonomy,'\" Wirawan admits. But she says she learned \"how to integrate social science and hard science, and how to involve the target audience into the design of the solution.\"\n\nDuring the rollout of the campaign, Wirawan lived alongside villagers. Coming from a different region of Indonesia, she had to overcome being perceived as an outsider. \"People had to decide, is this really the community's campaign? And can this leader be effective?\" She learned to listen for \"what people already know. They have knowledge. I helped facilitate how they can realize their potential.\" After the campaign ended, CI's scientific staff continued building on the grassroots support that Wirawan had established.\n\nSHARPENED FOCUS\n\nAlthough local leaders eventually own and implement each two-year campaign, in the early years Butler was still their primary trainer. \"It was impossible to take this model to scale,\" Butler says in hindsight. \"I was flying around the world every 10 weeks. We were going to have to clone me or kill me.\"\n\nWhen Jenks became Rare's CEO in 2000, after years of grassroots work in Central America, he was ready to bring together lessons learned on the ground with business school-style strategies. In 2000, the organization had a staff of seven and $60,000 in unrestricted assets. \"We were tiny and we were broke,\" Jenks says. Nevertheless, he set out to streamline Rare's operations. He began reading up on management theory on his own and eventually enrolled in business school at Georgetown University, completing his MBA in 2004.\n\nRare first decided to centralize the training of its Rare Pride campaign managers. In 2001, the organization brought five English-speaking Pride leaders from the tropics together for 10 weeks at its first training site, the University of Kent in England. Campaign managers (including Wirawan) now had the opportunity to learn from each other instead of only from Butler. They formed professional friendships that continued when they returned home, reducing their isolation in the field and creating a problem-solving network. With more time for training, they could fill knowledge gaps about biology, ecology, and social marketing  areas of expertise that aren't easy to find in one person. They also earned a diploma, which would help them advance in their careers. The model worked so well that Rare opened additional university training centers in Mexico and Indonesia to serve the non-English-speaking world.\n\nMeanwhile, and despite its small size, Rare had managed to design several programs in addition to Rare Pride. Jenks had personally developed Rare's ecotourism program, which was critically acclaimed but required a long-term investment of staff and resources at each site. Another program called Rare Radio produced a long-running series of soap operas in the Caribbean and Micronesia that incorporated information about family planning and HIV prevention along with environmental themes. The Fisheries Fellows Pilot Project trained seven fellows to help small-scale fishing operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"Until five years ago, we were basically an R&D shop,\" Jenks acknowledges. \"We had some of the best little products in the field, but we were not scaling anything.\"\n\nRare began to realize that expansion was essential for meeting its mission, says Rare COO Dale Galvin. That mission: to conserve imperiled species and ecosystems around the world by inspiring people to care about and protect nature. \"If we're going to make an impact in the world,\" Galvin says, \"we have to grow.\"\n\nAnd so two years ago, Rare's leadership team decided to focus almost all its organizational capacity on expanding Rare Pride. A tally of Rare Pride's successes doesn't look so impressive: 36 campaigns in 2007, 45 projected in 2008, 82 by 2011. Each resource-intensive campaign costs $100,000 and requires a two-year commitment from a partner organization in the targeted country.\n\nBut as Jenks points out, \"Our campaigns come in direct contact with millions of people in the richest ecosystems on Earth.\" Rare estimates its first 100 Pride campaigns involved 2,400 communities and touched some 6 million people in the developing tropics. \"When you think about scaling an effort to save species, to protect watersheds that serve the needs of millions of people, you can start to envision a much bigger impact. That's what's exciting,\" Jenks says. \"This is extremely high leverage.\"\n\nExpanding Rare Pride has meant dialing back support for the much-lauded ecotourism program and spinning off Rare Radio to another nonprofit. It has also entailed doubling Rare's staff to 50 and growing the annual budget from $5 million to $7.5 million. Now every aspect of the Rare Pride program is receiving intense scrutiny from the executive team, donors, and partner organizations. Jenks expects that attention to yield an even better program. \"We're working to select the best sites, the best partners, and the best campaign managers. If we can get those things right,\" he says, \"we see an increasingly high chance of success.\"\n\nPEOPLE FIRST\n\nDespite its recent growth, Rare still seems to belong to a species different from its larger, more famous conservation counterparts. The Nature Conservancy, for example, operates with an annual budget of more than $1 billion and a staff of thousands, including more than 700 scientists. Rare relies on these big international NGOs  nicknamed the bingos  to inform its work, as well as to cofinance more than half of its Rare Pride campaigns.\n\nYet bingos have drawn some criticism. In the journal Science last year, an international consortium of scientists from the Wildlife Trust Alliance compared them to transnational corporations that employ \"corporate-style branding\" and take \"top-down approaches\" to problems that ultimately must be addressed with local solutions.\n\nStephanie Meeks, former interim president and CEO of the Nature Conservancy, acknowledges a fairly recent shift in thinking about the role people play in conservation. \"The Nature Conservancy and a lot of other conservation organizations have started to talk more about conservation of the natural world for people instead of from people. The day has passed when conservationists talk about buying land and setting it aside,\" she says. \"We do that at our own peril.\"\n\nThe BINGOS are still learning how to make inroads with people living in small, poor communities in faraway places. Many of the hot spots where species threats are highest are also extremely remote, far from the reach of the \"save the Earth\" messages that echo across the West. In the developing tropics, \"there has been almost no marketing of environmental values,\" says Jenks. \"People living in these places often don't realize that what they have in their backyard is literally not found anywhere else on Earth.\"\n\nIn this sometimes rocky terrain, Rare has found a place to flourish. While carving out a unique niche, Rare has managed to create mutually beneficial relationships with partners large and small. That's important whether Rare is raising funds in the developed world or building grassroots alliances in the developing tropics. The organization has also become adept at telling the Rare Pride story. Each successful campaign leaves behind a legacy of attitudes changed, species preserved, and leadership enhanced.\n\nBOARDS FOR GROWTH\n\nBoard management has evolved alongside Rare's programming and leadership. In 2000, when Jenks took over as CEO, Rare's thirty-member board donated $140,000. The now sixteen-member board is on track to donate $4 million in 2008. To fund its expansion, the organization hopes to increase its budget to $18 million by 2011.\n\nShifting to a smaller \"but much more generous\" board has been a deliberate decision, Jenks says. Rare board member Joe Ellis, a former partner with the Goldman Sachs Group and an expert in retail analysis, has helped shape that evolution. When he joined several years ago, he \"loved what Rare was doing,\" but wanted to see a bigger impact. Ellis was willing to take on what he calls \"the rabble-rouser role\" to make that happen. \"Boards can have a tendency to be like clubs. We get together and share our love of conservation, but how much are we achieving? I felt impatient. I pushed hard for us to grow geometrically,\" he says.\n\nSoon after Ellis' arrival, he recruited Wendy Paulson, a well-respected conservation leader who has served on the board of the Nature Conservancy. Her connections helped bring in more people who could underwrite Rare's ambitious expansion plans. Many of the current board members are connected to other conservation organizations, especially the bingos. Their network has helped Rare strengthen partnerships.\n\nDonor generosity, particularly unrestricted gifts and multiyear pledges, has given Rare more flexibility. \"This gives us the opportunity to self-finance programs, or challenge other organizations to match us,\" Jenks explains.\n\nGoing after a few big donations \"is cheaper money in the long run than going after lots of little grants,\" adds Galvin. But big dollars bring bigger expectations. \"As our board members and donors become more sophisticated, it becomes more like a venture philanthropy approach to fundraising  with an expectation of transparency and results. It's a virtuous spiral,\" Galvin adds. \"With the right resources, you can make the best decisions for your product. You can hire the right people. That leads to more success and better stories, and brings in more donors. The board is the beginning of all that.\"\n\nHannelore Grantham is a Rare board member whose family foundation pledged $5 million to help jump-start the expansion. \"I'm involved with a number of other organizations, and I don't think anybody is quite as rigorous as Rare,\" she says. \"They have real business savvy. They're constantly examining the figures and methodology.\"\n\nTo reach the higher accountability bar, Rare has grown more scientific about its work with people, using measurement and metrics, and then looping that feedback into program improvement. A new technology platform called Rare Planet will support this process. Henry Poole, a technologist adept at social change and cofounder of Berkeley-based Civic Actions, is developing the platform with open source technologies. \"We're creating the kind of tool that enables groups to form and forge closer bonds,\" Poole explains. \"The objective is to enable Rare to grow its network exponentially.\" Rare Planet will also help each campaign develop a scorecard for monitoring individual results and capturing best practices.\n\nRARE 2.0\n\nTo prepare for expansion, Rare is overhauling its training program. In the new design, cohorts of twelve representatives will go through the training experience together. They will return to the training center three times during the two-year campaign for a total of eleven weeks of in-depth learning. The Rare Planet technology platform will allow for course management as well as networking among participants and Rare Pride alumni. \"We're taking it from version 1.0 to 2.0,\" says Butler. When candidates complete the two-year program, they will be eligible for a master's degree from the University of Texas at El Paso  another carrot that should help with recruitment.\n\nRare is also opening a training center in China, and plans to open additional sites for Portuguese speakers from Brazil and French speakers from Africa, bringing the total number of training sites to six. \"That will enable us to cover the most common languages of countries having the greatest natural resource base on Earth,\" Jenks explains. \"It's a mass customization of the social marketing of conservation.\"\n\nAs it expands, Rare asks itself: Can we grow and improve quality at the same time? \"It's a conundrum,\" admits Galvin, \"but others have done it.\" Jenks looks to Teach for America as an example of a program experiencing \"smart growth\" that has yielded not only an expanded program, but also better applicants.\n\nRare will also have to adapt to a more regional management style. What Ellis calls the \"garden rake structure,\" with multiple programs reporting to a single manager, is no longer a good fit for an organization that is working through decentralized networks. It's time for Rare to adapt  again. \"The hardest part isn't growing the program or growing the development,\" Ellis says. \"It's finding those great lieutenants who have experience managing across different cultures.\"\n\nThe solution, once again, has to do with people. That's Rare's story. And it's sticking to it.\n\nBy tailoring its methods to local values and needs, Rare has slowly seeded conservation programs in 40 countries. Yet as more and more species teeter on the brink of extinction, the organization must expand quickly. Here's how the boutique nonprofit is delivering customized Rare Pride social marketing campaigns to millions of people in the planet's most fragile ecosystems....",

        "content":"Have you ever felt lost or overwhelmed by the maze of tax laws, Treasury regulations, and IRS rules that apply to nonprofit organizations? In The Rules of the Road, author Betsy Buchalter Adler answers the questions of grantmakers and grantseekers alike concerning the laws governing charities in the United States.\n\nAdler, an attorney who specializes in tax-exempt organization law, teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and lectures frequently on legal issues of interest to nonprofit organizations.\n\nHer book begins with a look at the definition of a charity. The traditional common law definition, derived from English law, defines four charitable purposes: relief of poverty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, and other purposes beneficial to the community. According to the author, this multi-part definition had a strong influence on early American charitable law. But in the modern era the traditional definition has been largely superseded by a tax law definition of a charity as an organization that pays no tax on its income and whose donors receive a tax benefit for their donations.\n\nSucceeding chapters of The Rules of the Road look at the economic benefits of charitable status, including tax benefits for a charity and its donors; categories of public charities; laws concerning private foundations; restrictions on advocacy and lobbying; American philanthropy and foreign charitable activity; allowable commercial activities of charities; the election and duties of directors; and accountability at the state and federal levels. There are, in addition, several appendices, including a sample articles of incorporation, a reading list, and several examples of tax forms.\n\nWritten in \"plain\" English, The Rules of the Road should prove helpful to both grantmakers and grantseekers who want to understand how the laws governing nonprofit organizations apply to them. And the chapter on American philanthropy and foreign charitable activity should be especially helpful to U.S. nonprofits that are active outside the United States.\n\nFor additional citations to materials on this topic, refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject headings \"Laws regulating philanthropy-2000-2009\" or \"Nonprofit organizations-government regulations.\"\n\nThe Rules of the Road look at the definition of a charity; the economic benefits of charitable status, including tax benefits for a charity and its donors; categories of public charities; laws concerning private foundations; restrictions on advocacy and lobbying; American philanthropy and foreign charitable activity; allowable commercial activities of charities; the election and duties of directors; and accountability at the state and federal levels....",

        "title":"Reframing the Collaboration Debate",
        "content":"The word \"collaboration\" is the latest buzzword for foundations. It is used in many situations, both formal and informal, where foundations try to achieve things together. So what do we mean by collaboration? When does it make sense? What are the hurdles to be overcome? In this special feature, Barry Knight and Caroline Hartnell aim to answer these questions, with the help of contributors from all over the world who tell their real-life stories of how collaboration works in practice.\n\nIt is clear that \"collaboration\" is a warm and fuzzy word that carries subtle messages about how we should behave. This leads to an inherent bias in writings about collaboration  namely that it is a good thing, and that we need more of it. It is striking that two recent reports about collaboration, one from the European Foundation Centre (Multiplying Impact Through Philanthropic Collaboration, 25 pages, PDF) and one from the Council on Foundations (Effective Collaborations: Recommendations for a Connected Philanthropic Infrastructure, 35 pages, PDF), take this line. Both think that collaboration is essential and make recommendations about how to make it more effective.\n\nBut is the view that collaboration is a good thing the best starting point? Both reports make clear that, no matter what the received wisdom about the benefits of collaboration, when it comes to practicing it, many people and institutions are lukewarm at best and downright resistant at worst. Rather than glossing over these responses and trying to enhance the conditions under which people will collaborate, perhaps it would make more sense to start from the proposition that collaboration has no intrinsic value. This would force us to make the case for collaboration and to identify its proper role in the repertoire of actions available to foundations to get their work done. So, now that we've set a skeptical starting point:\n\nIs There Any Intrinsic Value in Collaboration?\n\nTo start us off, we invited Richard Best, former executive director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, to explain why he is adamant that sole funding is the best course of action for a foundation. He suggests that working independently enables a foundation to take full responsibility for its destiny. He explains that the extra money that collaboration brings is not worth the time and trouble that inevitably comes with it. Moreover, when the project is finished, it is clear who takes the credit. It is striking that, during his eighteen years at the foundation, Richard Best created a \"brand\" for Joseph Rowntree Foundation research that means that new reports are almost always covered by the news media.\n\nTo answer the arguments made by Richard Best, we invited Jeff Yost, executive director of the Nebraska Community Foundation, to explain why his organization puts collaboration at the heart of all it does. Yost concedes that independent action may be prudent for a particular project, if you can afford it and if it leads to unencumbered findings or action. However, such an approach would not deal with the central social and economic problem of Nebraska, where outmigration of young people threatens the very existence of many rural communities. Turning this around requires local people working together and pooling resources to help their communities survive and flourish. In this case, collaboration is an intrinsic part of what the Nebraska Community Foundation does: if local people were not working together, their activities would not make sense. This turns the starting point on its head: it's not that collaboration is of intrinsic value, but that collaboration is intrinsic to this activity.\n\nBoth of these contributions display impeccable logic in their arguments. We might therefore infer that the key question is not \"Is collaboration a good thing,\" but instead, \"When is collaboration a good thing?\"\n\nLittle Evidence for the Benefits of Collaboration\n\nIn their recent report for the European Foundation Centre, Marc Pfitzer and Mike Stamp suggest unequivocally that collaboration is a good thing. A growing number of foundations, they say, \"are not content to run small programs that bring limited benefits to a few direct beneficiaries. Rather, they are increasingly setting out bold ambitions to have a meaningful impact on the issues they care about: to shape policy, advance human knowledge, enrich cultures, or change behavior.\" They further suggest that collaboration \"is essential in order to assemble sufficient assets, expertise and influence to create such social impact.\" They go on to make the even larger claim that there is clear evidence that foundations working together can create much more impact than simply the sum of their parts.\n\nThese are over-inflated conclusions. The evidence base for the EFC report is wafer thin. Fourteen people were interviewed and seven people took part in a focus group. The report gives no hard evidence for the positive impact of collaborations. Indeed, the accomplishments of three featured collaborations look modest.\n\nNotwithstanding this critique, the report does include some interesting material and there are two reviews of the report in the March issue of Alliance magazine, one by Gran Blomqvist and the other by Filiz Bikmen Bugay. Both reviewers take a very practical and soundly based view of what it means for someone involved in the day-to-day work of a European foundation.\n\nWhat we conclude so far is that we must avoid investing too much in the idea of collaboration, thinking that it is the latest magic bullet that will cure all our ills. There are some examples where collaboration has worked; equally there are examples where it hasn't.\n\nWhere Collaboration Has Succeeded....\n\nLet us take two examples of where collaboration has been a success. John Kania and Mark Kramer have recently written about Strive Together, which has brought together local leaders to tackle student achievement in greater Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. This has involved more than three hundred leaders of private and corporate foundations, city government officials, school district representatives, the presidents of eight universities and community colleges, and hundreds of heads of non-profit groups. The result has been improvements in high school graduation rates, fourth-grade reading and math scores, and the number of preschool children prepared for kindergarten. Kania and Kramer reinforce their arguments by suggesting that this collaboration succeeded where individual efforts by a number of individual foundations, such as Annenberg, Ford and Pew, have failed. They characterize the collaborative effort as \"collective impact\" and the individual effort as \"isolated impact.\" Collaboration can be seen as an \"intrinsic\" element of this effort: school under-achievement is such a complex issue that it cannot be tackled unless all involved organizations work together.\n\nOur second successful example of a successful collaboration, the Partnership for Higher Education in Africa, was a ten-year collaboration of seven U.S. foundations. An evaluation report examines each foundation's contributions to the initiative, grants made by the collaborative, and the impact of those grants in the nine African countries targeted by the initiative. The report argues that not only did the initiative underwrite improvements in higher education infrastructure, capacity, and access in the nine countries in question, it also made it possible for the foundations involved to accomplish things that they could or would not have done had they each been acting on their own. Perhaps more significantly, being part of a collective helped the individual foundations improve the effectiveness of their own efforts by exposing them to new strategies, leveraging their grants with other grants, helping staff develop expertise, and suggesting other co-funding opportunities. This example shows that collaboration can benefit both the \"cause\" and the participating foundations and their staff.\n\n...And Where It Hasn't\n\nTurning to an example of failure, collaboration was the leitmotif for the UK's National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (2001-11), which was intended to close the gap between the poorest 10 percent of neighbourhoods and the rest. Agencies in the 88 poorest areas of the country were given extra resources to work together in partnerships to reduce inequality, but it didn't work and the program was quietly run down four years early. Many partnerships lacked direction; others lacked the requisite skills; others were beset with conflict.\n\nWhat Makes the Difference?\n\nSumming up where we have got so far, it seems that there are situations where collaboration is vital and others where it is not. What appears to make the difference is the complexity of the problem to be solved and whether collaboration is intrinsic to its solution. A suitable candidate for collaboration is a chronic problem embedded in systems or structures that requires different interventions from different organizations to deal with it. These conditions clearly apply in some of the collaborations discussed in the current issue. For example, Andrs Thompson describes a funders' collaborative designed to advance the neglected but problematic issue of race in Brazil. Briggs Bomba explains the need for a speedy intervention by a funders' collaborative to rebuild civil society in Zimbabwe following a decade of political and economic chaos.\n\nCollaboration in these circumstances fits with the conclusions of a recent Monitor Institute report: \"Although the individual grant is the typical unit of analysis for most foundations, the success of any grant or organization is rarely sufficient to move the needle on a complex problem. Funders are well positioned to support connectivity and to coordinate and knit together the pieces of a network of activity that can have impacts far beyond the success of any one grant, grantee, or donor.\"\n\nBalancing Costs and Benefits\n\nThis is easy to say, less easy to do. All the contributors to the March issue of Alliance magazine said that successful collaboration is a lot of work and should not be embarked on lightly. In his article about the Youth Empowerment Partnership Program (YEPP), Walter Veirs notes: \"We all soon learned that going beyond what we were doing individually and collaborating with other foundations to do something new was not as easy as it sounded.\" In her article about EPIM, Juliet Prager says: \"Collaboration is tough, tricky, and time-consuming.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the amount of work, almost all contributors in this issue see benefits. Walter Veirs says: \"YEPP has been a substantial investment of time and resources for all involved, but none of the participating foundations working alone would have got YEPP to where it is today.\" Juliet Prager notes: \"When it is done well, collaboration can be extremely worthwhile.\"\n\nIt seems that collaboration is a question of relative costs and benefits, and the central question is whether the benefits exceed the costs. It is evident from the various contributions in this issue that these costs and benefits occur at three main levels. The first is the level of the individual and how the collaboration impinges on his or her work; the second is the level of the organization and how the collaboration enhances or distorts its work; and the third is at the level of the field and the impact on the problem to be solved.\n\nCombining the comparison between costs and benefits and the three levels, we can produce a matrix to evaluate collaborations. We can also begin to fill in some of the factors to go inside the cells as follows.\n\nEvaluating Collaborations\n\nAre There Alternatives?\n\nLooking at this matrix in relation to the contributions of Walter Veirs, writing about YEPP, and Juliet Prager, writing about EPIM, it is clear that the entries on the costs side of the equation are high in both cases. But the benefits are also great, since it is hard to see how either program could have reached the levels of sophistication that they have, and the levels of impact that they report, without more than one funder.\n\nThe question may then become: how can the costs be reduced, and, more specifically, how can the time and effort be reduced? Are there forms of collaboration that are less intense that enable the same results with a lighter touch? As the Monitor Institute report puts it: \"Coordinating resources toward common goals no longer must mean developing a consensus-based collaborative. Funders are forging new ways of working together, from learning groups to strategic alignment networks, that fit different purposes and circumstances, allowing individual funders to aggregate and amass resources of all kinds and effectively 'punch above their weight'... These actors don't necessarily need to make decisions together, but they need their efforts to add up.\"\n\nThis has implications for the design of the collaboration. To collaborate means literally \"to work together.\" Working together can range from loose affiliation and networking through to coordinated approaches to problem solving through to full merger of organizations.\n\nWhatever design is chosen, it is important to avoid parties having to agree about everything. Community organizers working in the tradition of Saul Alinsky have found that most people in a coalition of organizations agree about 95 percent of things, but it's the 5 percent that they don't agree about that paralyses action. Successful organizing depends on finding ways to put the 5 percent onto one side and to get on with the rest. In making decisions about what to disregard, a good approach is to look at the matrix and ask the question: \"How can we minimize the costs and maximize the benefits?\" The answer is likely to result in a streamlined process that allows individual partners a degree of autonomy about how they get the work done.\n\nThinking About Collaborating\n\nIn this article, we have set out to reframe some of the issues involved in collaboration, which we believe is not a venture to embark on lightly. Here are some questions that people considering collaboration might like to think about before getting involved:\n\n\n\n\n\nCould you achieve the desired impact working on your own?\n\n\n\nIs collaboration an essential element of what you want to achieve?\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for impact in the field, and collaboration isn't essential, is collaboration likely to be worth it, given the inevitable costs particularly in terms of time and energy?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers to these questions may be more clear-cut if organizational and individual benefits are sought  because in this case the time spent on the process of collaboration is of intrinsic value. If benefits for the field are sought, questions need to be much more searching to ensure that interventions by the different parties bring the desired results.\n\nBarry Knight was guest editor for the March 2011 issue of Alliance magazine.

        "title":"The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle",
        "content":"A vicious cycle is leaving nonprofits so hungry for decent infrastructure that they can barely function as organizations  let alone serve their beneficiaries. The cycle starts with funders' unrealistic expectations about how much running a nonprofit costs, and results in nonprofits misrepresenting their costs while skimping on vital systems  acts that feed funders' skewed beliefs. To break the nonprofit starvation cycle, funders must take the lead.\n\nOrganizations that build robust infrastructure  which includes sturdy information technology systems, financial systems, skills training, fundraising processes, and other essential overhead  are more likely to succeed than those that do not. This is not news, and nonprofits are no exception to the rule.\n\nYet it is also not news that most nonprofits do not spend enough money on overhead. In our consulting work at the Bridgespan Group, we frequently find that our clients agree with the idea of improving infrastructure and augmenting their management capacity, yet they are loath to actually make these changes because they do not want to increase their overhead spending. But underfunding overhead can have disastrous effects, finds the Nonprofit Overhead Cost Study, a five-year research project conducted by the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. The researchers examined more than 220,000 IRS Form 990s and conducted 1,500 in-depth surveys of organizations with revenues of more than $100,000. Among their many dismaying findings: non-functioning computers, staff members who lacked the training needed for their positions, and, in one instance, furniture so old and beaten down that the movers refused to move it. The effects of such limited overhead investment are felt far beyond the office: non-functioning computers cannot track program outcomes and show what is working and what is not; poorly trained staff cannot deliver quality services to beneficiaries.\n\nDespite findings such as these, many nonprofits continue to skimp on overhead. And they plan to cut even more overhead spending to weather the current recession, finds a recent Bridgespan study. Surveying more than one hundred executive directors of organizations across the country, we found that 56 percent of respondents planned to reduce overhead spending. Yet decreasing already austere overhead spending (also called \"indirect expenses\") may jeopardize organizations' very existence  not to mention their ability to fulfill their missions. And although the Obama administration's stimulus package may fuel rapid growth among some nonprofits, many will lack the infrastructure to manage the windfall and may well be crushed under the weight of all those well-intended funds.\n\nWhy do nonprofits and funders alike continue to shortchange overhead? To answer this question, we studied four national nonprofits that serve youth. Each organization has a mix of funding, including monies from government, foundation, and individual sources. We also interviewed the leaders and managers of a range of nonprofit organizations and funders, as well as synthesized existing research on overhead costs in the nonprofit sector.\n\nOur research reveals that a vicious cycle fuels the persistent underfunding of overhead. The first step in the cycle is funders' unrealistic expectations about how much it costs to run a nonprofit. At the second step, nonprofits feel pressure to conform to funders' unrealistic expectations. At the third step, nonprofits respond to this pressure in two ways: They spend too little on overhead, and they underreport their expenditures on tax forms and in fundraising materials. This underspending and underreporting in turn perpetuates funders' unrealistic expectations. Over time, funders expect grantees to do more and more with less and less  a cycle that slowly starves nonprofits.\n\nAlthough several factors drive the cycle of nonprofit starvation, our research suggests that taking action at the first stage  funders' unrealistic expectations  could be the best way to slow or even stop the cycle. Changing funders' expectations, however, will require a coordinated sector-wide effort. At a time when people need nonprofit services more than ever and when government is increasingly turning to nonprofits to solve social problems, this effort is necessary to keep nonprofits healthy and functioning.\n\nFunders' Unrealistic Expectations\n\nThe nonprofit starvation cycle is the result of deeply ingrained behaviors, with a chicken-and-egg-like quality that makes it hard to determine where the dysfunction really begins. Our sense, however, is that the most useful place to start analyzing this cycle is with funders' unrealistic expectations. The power dynamics between funders and their grantees make it difficult, if not impossible, for nonprofits to stand up and address the cycle head-on; the downside to doing so could be catastrophic for the organization, especially if other organizations do not follow suit. Particularly in these tough economic times, an organization that decides  on its own  to buck the trend and report its true overhead costs could risk losing major funding. The organization's reputation could also suffer. Resetting funder expectations would help pave the way for honest discussions with grantees.\n\nMany funders know that nonprofit organizations report artificially low overhead figures, and that the donor literature often reflects grossly inaccurate program ratios (the proportion of program-related expenses to indirect expenses). Without accurate data, funders do not know what overhead rates should be. Although for-profit analogies are not perfect for nonprofits, they do provide some context for thinking about how realistic  or not  average overhead rates in the nonprofit sector are. Overhead rates across for-profit industries vary, with the average rate falling around 25 percent of total expenses. And among service industries  a closer analog to nonprofits  none report average overhead rates below 20 percent.\n\nIn the absence of clear, accurate data, funders must rely on the numbers their grantees report. But as we will later discuss, these data are riddled with errors. As a result, funders routinely require nonprofits to spend unhealthily small amounts on overhead. For instance, all four of the youth service organizations that we studied were managing government contracts from local, state, and federal sources, and none of the contracts allowed grantees to use more than 15 percent of the grant for indirect expenses (which include operations, finances, human resources, and fundraising).\n\nSome foundations allot more money for indirect costs than do government agencies. Yet foundations are quite variable in their indirect cost allowances, with the average ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent of each grant. These rates hold true even for some of the largest, most influential U.S. foundations. And foundations can be just as rigid with their indirect cost policies as government funders.\n\nMany times, the indirect allowances that grants do fund don't even cover the costs of administering the grants themselves. For example, when one Bridgespan client added up the hours that staff members spent on reporting requirements for a particular government grant, the organization found that it was spending about 31 percent of the value of the grant on its administration. Yet the funder had specified that the nonprofit spend only 13 percent of the grant on indirect costs.\n\nMost funders are aware that their indirect cost rates are indeed too low, according to a recent study by Grantmakers for Effective Organizations. In this national survey of more than eight hundred grantmaking foundations, only 20 percent of the respondents said that their grants include enough overhead allocation to cover the time that grantees spend on reporting.\n\nIndividual donors' expectations are also skewed. A 2001 survey conducted by the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance found that more than half of American adults felt that nonprofit organizations should have overhead rates of 20 percent or less, and nearly four out of five felt that overhead spending should be held at less than 30 percent. In fact, those surveyed ranked overhead ratio and financial transparency to be more important attributes in determining their willingness to give to an organization than the success of the organization's programs.\n\nNot only do funders and donors have unrealistic expectations, but the nonprofit sector itself also promotes unhealthy overhead levels. \"The 20 percent norm is perpetuated by funders, individuals, and nonprofits themselves,\" says the CFO of one of the organizations we studied. \"When we benchmarked our reported financials, we looked at others, [and] we realized that others misreport as well. One of our peer organizations allocates 70 percent of its finance director's time to programs. That's preposterous!\"\n\nIn this context, nonprofits are reluctant to break ranks and be honest in their fundraising literature, even if they know that they are fueling unrealistic expectations. They find it difficult to justify spending on infrastructure when nonprofits commonly tout their low overhead costs. For example, Smile Train, an organization that treats children born with cleft lip and palate conditions, has claimed that \"100 percent of your donation will go toward programs...zero percent goes to overhead.\" Nevertheless, the fine print goes on to say that this is not because the organization has no overhead; rather, it is because Smile Train uses contributions from \"founding supporters\" to cover its non-program costs.\n\nThis constellation of causes feeds the second stage in the nonprofit starvation cycle: pressure on nonprofits to conform to unrealistic expectations. This pressure comes from a variety of sources, finds the Nonprofit Overhead Cost Study. The survey found that 36 percent of respondents felt pressure from government agencies, 30 percent felt pressure from donors, and 24 percent felt pressure from foundations.\n\nUnderfed Overhead\n\nIn response to pressure from funders, nonprofits settle into a \"low pay, make do, and do without\" culture, as the Nonprofit Overhead Cost Study calls it. Every aspect of an organization feels the pinch of this culture. In our consulting work with nonprofits, for example, we often see clients who are unable to pay competitive salaries for qualified specialists, and so instead make do with hires who lack the necessary experience or expertise. Similarly, many organizations that limit their investment in staff training find it difficult to develop a strong pipeline of senior leaders.\n\nThese deficits can be especially damaging to youth-serving organizations, notes Ben Paul, president and CEO of After-School All-Stars, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that provides afterschool and summer camp programs for at-risk youth nationwide. \"It is clear to anyone who has led an organization that the most important capital in a company is the human capital,\" says Paul. \"In afterschool we have a saying: kids come for the program, but stay for the staff. If we don't hire the right people, we might as well not run afterschool programs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, without strong tracking systems, nonprofits have a hard time diagnosing which actions truly drive their desired outcomes. \"The catch-22 is that, while organizations need capacity-building funding in order to invest in solid performance tracking, many funders want to see strong program outcome data before they will provide such general operating support,\" says Jamie McAuliffe, a portfolio manager at the New York-based Edna McConnell Clark Foundation.\n\nTake the case of a well-respected network of youth development programs. To protect the identity of this organization, we will call it the Learning Goes On Network (LGON). Poised for a huge growth spurt, LGON realized that its data systems would be hopelessly inadequate to accommodate more clients. An analysis showed that program staff spent 25 percent of their time collecting data manually. One staff member spent 50 percent of her time typing results into an antiquated Microsoft Access database.\n\nStaff members can become so accustomed to their strained circumstances that they have trouble justifying even much-needed investments in overhead, our interviews revealed. \"We [had] known for a long time that a COO was vital to our growth but [hadn't] been able to fund one,\" relates the CEO of one of the four youth development organizations that we studied. But when his organization's board finally created the COO position, the rest of the staff resisted. \"They had lived so long in a starved organization that the idea of hiring a COO was shocking to them.\"\n\nMisleading Reporting\n\nThe final driver of the cycle that starves nonprofit infrastructure is nonprofits' routine misrepresentation of how much they actually spend on overhead. The numbers that nonprofits report on their financial statements \"[defy] plausibility,\" finds the Nonprofit Overhead Cost Study. Upon examination of more than 220,000 nonprofit organizations, researchers found that more than a third of the organizations reported no fundraising costs whatsoever, while one in eight reported no management and general expenses. Further scrutiny found that 75 percent to 85 percent of these organizations were incorrectly reporting the costs associated with grants.\n\nOur study of the four youth-serving nonprofits likewise reported discrepancies between what nonprofits spent on overhead and what they reported spending. Although they reported overhead rates ranging from 13 percent to 22 percent, their actual overhead rates ranged from 17 percent to 35 percent.\n\nMany factors support this underreporting of nonprofit costs. According to a survey conducted by The Chronicle of Philanthropy in 2000, a majority of nonprofits say that their accountants advised them to report zero in the fundraising section of Form 990. Limited surveillance of nonprofits' Form 990 tax reports only exacerbates the problem: The IRS rarely levies the $50,000 penalty for an incomplete or inaccurate return, and generally applies it only when an organization deliberately fails to file the form altogether. According to the Chronicle study, \"Improperly reporting these expenses is likely to have few, if any, consequences.\"\n\nThe IRS' ambiguous instructions likewise lead to error, report several sources. For example, nowhere does the IRS explicitly address how to account for nonprofit marketing and communications. As a result, many organizations allocate all marketing and communications expenses to programs when, in most cases, these expenses should be reported as administrative or fundraising overhead.\n\nGovernment agencies likewise have varying and ambiguous definitions of indirect costs. The White House Office of Management and Budget, for example, defines indirect costs as \"those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective.\" It then goes on to say that \"because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of nonprofit organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of cost that may be classified as indirect cost in all situations.\"\n\nThere is some good news. Currently, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) is conducting a study of various federal grantors' definitions of indirect costs. As Stan Czerwinski, the director of strategic issues for GAO, explains, \"The goal is to achieve consistency, so that when nonprofits go in for funding, they have clarity (as do funders) about what they're actually going to get reimbursed for.\" The study is in the early stages, but as Czerwinski notes, the need is clear: \"We don't find anybody telling us that we're barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\nProper Care and Feeding\n\nAlthough the vicious cycle of nonprofit starvation has many entry points and drivers, we believe that the best place to end it is where it starts: Funders' unrealistic expectations. Foundations and government funders must take the lead because they have an enormous power advantage over their grantees. When funders change their expectations, nonprofits will feel less need to underreport their overhead. They will also feel empowered to invest in infrastructure.\n\nThe first step that funders should take is to shift their focus from costs to outcomes. In the nonprofit world, organizations are so diverse that they do not share a common indicator of program effectiveness. In the absence of this indicator, many funders try to understand an organization's efficiency by monitoring overhead and other easily obtained yet faulty indicators. Funders need to refocus their attention on impact by asking \"What are we trying to achieve?\" and \"What would define success?\" In so doing, they will signal to their grantees that impact matters more than anything else. Even focusing on approximate or crude indicators (for example, \"Are we getting an A or a C on our impact goals?\") is better than looking at cost efficiencies, as focusing on the latter may lead to narrow decisions that undermine program results.\n\nFunders must also clearly communicate their program goals to their grantees. Having established that funder and grantee share the same goals, funders should then insist on honest answers to the question \"What will it take to deliver these outcomes consistently, or to deliver these outcomes at an even higher level of quality or quantity?\"\n\nOne of our study participants, for instance, worked closely with its major funder to think through this question and ultimately determined it needed a sizable investment in technology to support its projected growth. The funder agreed that only by making such an investment would the organization be able to track outcomes uniformly and to make program improvements quickly.\n\nWhen feasible, funders should help meet grantees' identified infrastructure needs by making general operating support grants. Grantmakers and nonprofits agree that more operating support is very likely to improve an organization's ability to achieve results, according to the 2008 Grantmakers for Effective Organizations study. And a 2006 CompassPoint Nonprofit Services study of nearly two thousand nonprofit executives in eight metropolitan areas reveals that receiving general operating support played a major role in reducing burnout and stress among executive directors. Yet although 80 percent of the foundations in this study made some general operating grants, they dedicated a median of only 20 percent of their grant dollars to this kind of support.\n\nRegardless of the type of support they provide, funders should encourage open, candid discussions with their grantees about what the latter need to be effective. Many funders' grantmaking processes are not set up to consider the full scope of what grantees do, and why. As a result, their grants are not as flexible as they need to be. Yet when funders fully understand their grantees' operations, they are more likely to meet their grantees' needs.\n\nAlthough changing their expectations will have the greatest impact on the nonprofit starvation cycle, funders can also intervene in other useful ways. When making use-restricted grants, funders should commit to paying a greater share of administrative and fundraising costs. Indeed, in 2004, the board of Independent Sector encouraged funders to pay \"the fair proportion of administrative and fundraising costs necessary to manage and sustain whatever is required by the organization to run that particular project.\"\n\nLikewise, rather than prescribing an indirect expense rate for all grants, government funders should allow nonprofits to define their true overhead needs in grant applications and, so long as these needs are justifiable, pay for them. For example, some federal funding contracts allow a nonprofit to justify an indirect cost rate (within guidelines), which the organization can then use for all its federal grant applications. Extending such a policy to all federal, state, and local government contracts would go a long way toward helping nonprofits deliver better programs while being able to pay for their grants' management.\n\nFinally, to foster transparent and accurate reporting, funders should encourage the development of a standard definition of the term overhead. Currently, organizations have to report their overhead differently for nearly every grant that they receive. Standardization would allow funders to compare apples with apples, as well as allow grantees to understand better their own overhead investments  or lack thereof. Having a dialogue about real overhead rates could also help shift the focus to the real target: outcomes.\n\nWhat Grantees Can Do\n\nThe burden of breaking the cycle of nonprofit starvation does not rest solely with funders. Nonprofit leaders also play a role. As a baseline task, they should commit to understanding their real overhead costs and their real infrastructure needs. At LGON, for instance, senior managers spent several months digging into their costs, analyzing their current systems  including the organization's subpar tracking process  and identifying gaps in capacity. After this strategic planning process, the organization could articulate a clear plan for a new tracking system and a 150 percent increase in nonprogram staff over three years.\n\nNonprofits must then speak truth to power, sharing their real numbers with their boards and then engaging their boards' support in communicating with funders. Case studies of organizations that have successfully invested in their own infrastructure have repeatedly noted the need for a shared agenda between the leadership team and the board. The executive director of LGON, for example, communicated early and often with her board members throughout the strategic planning process. She also facilitated several meetings to address infrastructure needs.\n\nFor their part, board members should ask the tough questions before funders do, namely: \"What does this organization really need to succeed?\" \"Where are we underinvesting?\" and \"What are the risks we're taking by underinvesting in these areas?\" Board members should encourage nonprofit leaders to develop strategies that explicitly recognize infrastructure needs. In developing plans for infrastructure, board members can help, notes Chris Brahm, chairman of the board of directors at Larkin Street Youth Services, a San Francisco nonprofit that serves homeless and runaway youth: \"The people running agencies are often consumed with programs and raising money. Board members, whether businesspeople or otherwise, can bring external perspective on overhead services.\"\n\nAt LGON, for example, the executive director identified a handful of board members who were fervent supporters of the emerging strategic vision. These board members then communicated to their colleagues how much overhead this vision would require.\n\nDuring these discussions, both board members and managers should focus on how investments in infrastructure will benefit the organization's beneficiaries, rather than reduce costs. Even within the confines of a \"cost conversation,\" they should emphasize how infrastructure investments may actually reduce the costs of serving beneficiaries over time. One organization in our study, for instance, determined that an investment in technological infrastructure yielded $350,000 per year by freeing up staff time and consolidating \"scrappy\" systems.\n\nFinally, organizations must attempt to educate their donors. \"Donors don't want to pay for an organization's rent, or phone bill, or stamps,\" notes Paul, \"but those are essential components of everyday work. You can't run a high-performing organization from your car. And there are many ways to explain these types of expenses to donors.\"\n\nBoth funders and grantees are feeling the sting of the current recession. But this economic downturn is no excuse to cut overhead funding. \"If a nonprofit's leaders are feeling as if they cannot raise money to support overhead, I think they're confusing the issue,\" says Brahm. \"The real issue is that they can't raise enough money, period. Either they do not have, or they have not been able to communicate, a results story that is compelling to funders.\"\n\nRather than being the reason to reduce overhead spending, the recession is an excellent opportunity to redress decades-long underinvestment in nonprofit infrastructure. \"There is real potential for change if all of the major stakeholders  government, private funders, and the nonprofits themselves  take steps to acknowledge that capacity building is critical to the health of an organization,\" says McAuliffe. And although the forces that fuel the nonprofit starvation cycle are strong, the opportunity to achieve more for beneficiaries in the long term should compel funders and grantees alike to stop the cycle.\n\nFormer Bridgespan Group manager William Bedsworth contributed to this article.\n\nAnn Goggins Gregory is the director of knowledge management at the Bridgespan Group and a former consultant in Bridgespan's strategy area.

        "title":"Behind the Curve",
        "content":"In 2004, the U.S. government-backed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) certified the West African nation of Senegal as eligible to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid. Initially, Senegal seemed like an excellent choice for a grant from the MCC, which targets aid to poor countries that are committed to good governance, free markets, and investments in people. Senegal is one of the few African states that has never had a coup d'tat. And since the nation became independent from France in 1960, Senegal's leaders have peacefully transferred power two times  most recently in 2000, when citizens elected the current president, Abdoulaye Wade. In addition, the country has encouraged private sector-led development and has at least officially welcomed foreign companies.\n\nSince Wade's election, however, Senegal's enthusiasm for economic freedom, poverty reduction, and sustainable growth seems to have flagged. For instance, after giving the French and Canadian consortium Hydro Qubec International-Elyo a 34 percent stake in Senelec, Senegal's monopoly electricity supplier, the Senegalese government would not allow the company to recoup its investment by raising prices. Frustrated in their attempts to turn a profit and to modernize the ramshackle power system, the investors were forced to accept a government buyout after less than eighteen months.\n\nLikewise, Luxembourg-based Millicom International Cellular has encountered problems with the Wade administration. Since receiving a twenty-year license in 1998, Millicom, whose local subsidiary operates under the Tigo brand, has invested heavily in the Senegalese market (more than $90 million in 2008 alone) to grow a nationwide network of 1.8 million loyal subscribers  one-sixth of Senegal's population. Since Wade took office, however, the government has tried to pressure Millicom into renegotiating its license and paying an additional $200 million. In September 2008, the government issued a decree that purported to terminate Millicom's license and seize its holdings. The company is currently seeking arbitration through the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Subsequently, the Senegalese government has threatened to charge the firm's general manager with illegal gambling because of a Tigo sales promotion that awarded prizes (such as a goat) to participating customers.\n\nSenegal's commitment to good governance is also waning, with the Wade government following an all-too-familiar pattern of seeking to perpetuate itself indefinitely. Wade initially promised to serve only one seven-year term, but in 2007 he was reelected to a second five-year term. And since he came to power, some elections have been delayed up to a year. Meanwhile, in June, the Senegalese parliament created a presidentially appointed vice president post, which many speculate will go to the president's son, Karim. In his previous government posts, including oversight of the 2008 Organization of the Islamic Conference summit in Dakar, Karim Wade was criticized for cost overruns and accused of corruption.\n\nDespite its departures from the MCC's selection criteria, Senegal is on track to receive major funding from the organization. In April 2009, the MCC even gave the Senegalese government a $13.39 million grant to help the latter get ready to sign a \"compact,\" as the agency calls its multiyear funding agreements. The compact, which the MCC lists as its leading priority, would pour hundreds of millions into infrastructure projects  which Karim Wade would direct.\n\nAlthough it is possible that the MCC's local administrators in Senegal are corrupt, a better explanation for the MCC's misguided investments is that bureaucrats in Washington are relying on out-of-date, inaccurate, third-party information. In turn, aid recipients, as rational economic actors, sense the weaknesses in the MCC's selection and monitoring processes and then exploit them to their own advantage. This is happening not only in Senegal, but also in other countries eligible for MCC compacts. For example, after Mongolia received a five-year, $285 million grant in 2007, it turned against private investors, slapping a staggering 68 percent \"windfall profits\" tax on holders of copper- and gold-mining licenses. Yet Mongolia's decidedly anti-development actions did not affect its MCC funding.\n\nFor the MCC to achieve its mission of reducing global poverty through sustainable economic growth, it needs to consider its data more critically. It also needs more timely assessments of grantees.\n\nFaith-Based Science\n\nEstablished in 2004, the MCC is arguably one of the most significant foreign policy legacies of George W. Bush's presidency. The MCC uses seventeen third-party-generated policy indicators to select recipient nations for large, multiyear, flexible grants, called Millennium Challenge Compacts. These compacts allow recipients to define their greatest obstacles to sustainable development and then to determine how to overcome these obstacles. Twenty of the thirty-nine countries that are eligible for MCC funding are in Africa, and more than three-quarters of the funding committed so far has been destined for the continent.\n\nAlthough initiated by a Republican administration, the MCC continues to enjoy broad bipartisan support. President Barack Obama himself requested an almost two-thirds increase in funding for the MCC for 2010, raising its budget to $1.43 billion. Yet the very reason for the MCC's popularity  the program's use of \"objective\" selection criteria  actually undermines its broader goals. To shield its decision-making process from undue politicization, the MCC relies on third parties to generate the data it uses to select grantees. To assess countries' regard for civil liberties and human rights, for instance, the MCC consults Washington, D.C.- based Freedom House scores. Using a 1 to 7 scale (on which 1 is the highest rating and 7 is the lowest), the 2008 edition of Freedom House's Freedom in the World report gives Senegal a rating of 2 on political freedom and a 3 on civil liberties. These ratings designate Senegal a \"free country\"  one of fewer than a dozen African states. These third parties, however, take a long time to gather and analyze their data. The most recent Freedom House scores, for example, come from the group's 2008 report, which is based on observations from the first part of 2007. By the time the MCC uses the third-party indicators to make decisions, some of the inputs are several years old and may no longer represent the facts on the ground.\n\nPotential aid recipients seem to be aware of this loophole and time their backsliding accordingly. In the case of Senegal, the current MCC scorecard does not capture the country's increasingly unfriendly investment climate or the Wades' tightening grip on power, both of which will impact the country's economic prospects. Yet the U.S. State Department's most recent annual report on investment climate  a more subjective document  warns that \"potential investors, and indeed all businesses, face obstacles, including non-transparent regulation and high factor costs\" and that \"court rulings can be inconsistent, arbitrary, and non-transparent.\"\n\nIn short, although the use of third-party indicators reassures observers that the MCC is practicing \"smart aid,\" appearances can be deceiving. The notion that numerical indicators are more scientific than qualitative analysis is based more on conceit than on evidence.\n\nBetter Aid to Africa\n\nOver the past fifty years, Africa has received more than $1 trillion in foreign assistance. After subtracting the $400 billion that these countries have paid back, the continent has received a net transfer of more than $600 billion. Yet donors and recipients have little to show for this unprecedented redistribution of wealth. Although a few African countries have recorded impressive economic growth in recent years, per capita income across the continent remains essentially where it was in 1960. In 2008, all twenty-two countries that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) characterized as having \"low human development\" were in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis failure of foreign aid suggests that simply increasing assistance levels will not necessarily buy more development. Indeed, my conclusion is quite the opposite: Unless aid carefully avoids reinforcing flawed policies, supporting poor governance, weakening African institutions, and creating dependence, it will actually buy less development. I am not alone in this conclusion; New York University economics professor William Easterly and former World Bank consultant Dambisa Moyo have also indicted foreign aid. (For a review of Moyo's Dead Aid, see the summer 2009 issue of the Stanford Social Innovation Review.) Likewise, as Rwandan President Paul Kagame declared in the Financial Times this year, \"The cycle of aid and poverty is durable: As long as poor countries are focused on receiving aid they will not work to improve their economies.\"\n\nYet many other African leaders are still willing to play on donors' lingering colonial guilt. And despite widespread criticisms of current practices, donor countries are unlikely to scale back their assistance anytime soon. If no one turns off the spigots of foreign aid, then donors must at least make aid more effective by adopting more strategic approaches. The MCC is a valiant attempt at this. But if the granting of hundreds of millions of dollars to countries like Senegal is any indication, it has a long way to go before it will truly revolutionize foreign assistance. Decisions about aid need to be not only well intentioned, but also well researched and well timed.\n\nOver the past 50 years, Africa has received more than $1 trillion in foreign assistance. After subtracting the $400 billion that these countries have paid back, the continent has received a net transfer of more than $600 billion. Yet donors and recipients have little to show for this unprecedented redistribution of wealth.",

        "title":"Cultivating the Green Consumer",
        "content":"At long last, the impulse to go green is spreading faster than a morning glory. Organizations of all types are launching green campaigns  from the city of London's congestion charge on automobiles, to Wal-Mart's push to sell organic foods, to the University of Texas' construction of LEED green buildings. Consumers are also getting behind the idea of being greener. In almost every opinion poll, consumers say that they are very concerned about climate change. They worry about rising seas, declining air quality, shrinking animal habitats, lengthening droughts, and newly brewing diseases. And they connect the dots back to their own purchases, according to a 2007 McKinsey & Company global survey of 7,751 consumers in eight major economies. Our results show that a full 87 percent of these consumers are concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the products they buy.\n\nBut when it comes to actually buying green goods, words and deeds often part ways. Only 33 percent of consumers in our survey say they are ready to buy green products or have already done so. And, according to a 2007 Chain Store Age survey of 822 U.S. consumers, only 25 percent say they have bought a green product other than organic food or energy efficient lighting. By and large, consumers tend to ignore other Earth-friendly products such as carpets made from recycled fiber and energy-saving computers.\n\nEven the green goods that have caught on have tiny market shares. Organic foods  which consumers buy more for their own health than for the environment's  accounted for less than 3 percent of all food sales in 2006, according to the Nutrition Business Journal. In 2006, green laundry detergents and household cleaners made up less than 2 percent of sales in their categories. And despite their trendiness, hybrid cars made up little more than 2 percent of the U.S. auto market in 2007, according to a report by J.D. Power and Associates.\n\nAs a result, consumers in the United States and other developed countries have done little to lighten their carbon footprints. Some of this lag between talking and walking could reflect consumers' insincerity, laziness, posturing, or other unsavory traits. But much more of it is because businesses have not educated consumers about the benefits of green products and have failed to create green products that meet consumers' needs.\n\nConsumers want to act green, but they expect businesses to lead the way. According to our global survey, 61 percent of consumers say that corporations should take the lead in tackling the issue of climate change. To do this, businesses need to develop more and better Earth-friendly products. Some already are, but they are not doing a good job of marketing them, finds a Climate Group study, which discovered that two-thirds of American and British consumers cannot name a green brand. Similarly, the 2007 National Technology Readiness Survey of 1,025 U.S. adults found that more than two thirds of participants say they prefer to do business with environmentally responsible companies, but almost half say it is difficult to find green goods and services.\n\nCorporations can reap multiple benefits by going green. They can reduce their energy consumption, lessen their risks, meet competitive threats, enhance their brands, and increase their revenues. Consider the success of compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), for example. In 2005, sales of CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of the total lightbulb market. But only two years later, in 2007  the year that the public woke up to the looming threat of climate change  CFLs captured an estimated 20 percent of the lightbulb market, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Companies that sell CFLs, like General Electric Co. (GE), have increased their revenues, enhanced their brands, and strengthened their competitive positions in the market.\n\nTo realize the true potential of the green market, businesses must help consumers change their behaviors. And that requires removing the hurdles between would-be green consumers' intentions and actions. Based on McKinsey's work with businesses and other organizations around the world, we have identified five of these hurdles. We also recommend five steps that businesses and other organizations should take to dismantle all of the barriers that prevent consumers from buying green.\n\nWHY ECO'S A NO-GO\n\nOur 2007 study of 7,751 consumers around the world identifies barriers to buying green at every stage of the purchase. First, consumers have to be aware that a product exists before they buy it. Yet many don't even know about the green alternatives in many product categories. Next, consumers must believe that a product will get the job done. But many believe that green products are of lower quality than their more traditional \"browner\" counterparts. Consumers must then decide whether a product lives up to its green reputation. Yet many are skeptical about environmental claims, partly because they distrust corporations and the media. Finally, consumers must decide whether a product is worth the cost and effort needed to purchase it. But consumers often believe that the prices of green goods are too high, and have a hard time finding them anyway.\n\nTo increase the sales of environmentally sensible products, companies must remove these five barriers--namely, lack of awareness, negative perceptions, distrust, high prices, and low availability. In other words, they must increase consumers' awareness of green products, improve consumers' perceptions of eco-products' quality, strengthen consumers' trust, lower the prices of green products, and increase these products' availability.\n\nThe importance of each barrier varies by product, industry, and geography. For instance, more than 90 percent of consumers who participated in the McKinsey global survey know about CFLs, so lack of awareness is not a barrier to their purchasing them. But many customers think CFLs are too expensive and of dubious quality. In other words, high price and negative perceptions impede these consumers' progress toward a greener purchase. In contrast, only half of the participants in this study know about carbon credits, which are a way that an individual or business can lower its carbon footprint. Companies that sell these credits invest the money in renewable energy, reforestation, and other activities that reduce carbon emissions, offsetting the emissions of the individual or business that purchased the carbon credit.\n\nAcross regions, moreover, consumers have different concerns about price and quality within the same product category. In the retail sector, for example, 14 percent of U.S. consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, compared to 26 percent in Brazil, according to the McKinsey global survey. In the petroleum sector, 7 percent of French consumers are willing to pay a premium, compared to 26 percent in India.\n\nAlthough the barriers between green thoughts and acts vary by product, industry, and region, the need to remove all barriers does not. In other words, companies have to move customers through the entire purchasing process--from being aware of eco-friendly products, to considering their pros and cons, to paying for the products. Understanding these barriers is the first step to growing green consumers.\n\nFIVE BARRIERS TO GREENING\n\nLack of Awareness Our study and others (such as London-based Account Ability's report \"What Assures Consumers on Climate Change?\") show that consumers know about climate change, understand that reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions will help fight climate change, and want to join that effort. But these studies also show that consumers do not quite understand how to act on their greener impulses. More than one-third of consumers we surveyed say they would like to take action against climate change but do not know what to do.\n\nFor example, the top three ways for consumers to reduce their own emissions of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) are to drive a more fuel-efficient car, improve their home's insulation, and reduce their consumption of beef. Yet the consumers in our study thought that using energy-efficient appliances and recycling were among the top three emission-cutting acts. (They correctly identified driving a more efficient car as one of the top three.) And although eating less beef is among the top three best acts of greenness, the fewest consumers knew how eco-friendly this behavior is.\n\nConsumers are equally confused about buying green products  and with good reason. Many attempts to label green products are meaningless at best and bewildering at worst. For example, a current labeling program indicates how much carbon dioxide an item's production, packaging, and shipment emitted--that is, its \"carbon footprint.\" But calculating carbon footprints requires some very fancy math and results in numbers that few people intuitively understand. \"What does it mean to say a bag of chips contains 75 grams of carbon?\" asked Steve Howard, CEO of the Climate Group, in a March 6, 2008, BusinessWeek article. \"I have a PhD in environmental physics and it does not mean a thing to me.\"\n\nNegative Perceptions Even when consumers can correctly identify environmentally sound products, the green label sometimes proves to be the kiss of death. Some green products  such as Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius automobile  have become status symbols, but many environmentally friendly products suffer an image problem. According to the 2007 GfK Roper Green Gauge study of more than 2,000 Americans, fully 61 percent believe that green goods perform worse than conventional items. Indeed, early green products often trailed behind their conventional competition. Early hybrid cars, for example, had less power than non-hybrid cars. CFL light bulbs also had to overcome problems: Early versions were slow to light up, had weak light when they did illuminate, and didn't fit properly into most normal light fixtures.\n\nDistrust Consumers doubt not only the quality of green products, but also their very greenness, according to the GfK Roper survey. Although they trust the environmental claims of scientists and environmental groups, they tend not to believe the claims of government, media, and business--and justifiably. A 2007 study by TerraChoice Environmental Marketing Inc. (\"The Six Sins of Greenwashing\") examined 1,753 environmental product claims and found that all but one were misleading or just plain false. In the misleading category: Some companies tout product features that are actually mandated by law. For example, TerraChoice found insecticides, lubricants, oven cleaner gels, cleaners, and disinfectants all labeled as CFC-free. But no products sold today in the United States have CFCs, because the federal government banned the ozone-eating propellants almost three decades ago. Other companies mislead consumers by highlighting one positive product feature while not mentioning their other negative qualities. For instance, paper or lumber products tout their recycled content or sustainable harvesting without noting the impact of their manufacturing processes on air and water emissions or global warming. And in the just plain false category: A dishwasher detergent boasted on its 100 percent plastic container that it used 100 percent recycled paper.\n\nHigh Prices Consumers who get past the sometimes checkered history of eco-friendly products often encounter a fourth barrier: their frequently higher prices. Indeed, price is the largest barrier to buying green products, found the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in its 2007 survey of 3,600 U.K. consumers. Close to half of this survey's participants want a two-year return on the premium price they pay for a product. Yet 70 percent of green appliances, including energy-efficient televisions, washers, and dryers, take longer to recoup their purchasers' money. Solar power is another example where, according to our analysis of data from the California Energy Commission, a combination of recent technological advances, government subsidies, and good weather have helped reduce the payback period to less than 10 years in California, making residential photovoltaic usage a practical reality for some consumers but still an expensive luxury for others. Because consumers perceive the benefits of green goods to be small and long term, they often view the often higher costs of these products to be too high.\n\nLow Availability Having decided to buy Earth-friendly items, many consumers encounter a final hurdle: They can't find them. Biofuel enthusiasts, for example, must often drive out of their way to fill up on their chosen fuel. Many energy-conscious homeowners have no other choice than to buy dirty power because their local utilities simply do not offer clean energy. And many contractors do not know where to purchase green building materials. The reason consumers cannot find these products is that businesses are not stocking them. In 2007, we did an informal survey of 23 grocery retailers in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. We found that fewer than half offered green products besides organic food and CFLs. Among the minority that did proffer eco-friendly nonfood items, only about 10 percent stocked more than one product.\n\nBREAKING DOWN BARRIERS\n\nKnowing what stops consumers from buying green products is only half the battle. The other half is knowing how to break down these barriers. Below are five steps for removing the hurdles between green thoughts and green acts. Companies first need to figure out which customers are likely to want which products. They must then examine how people in these different market segments make their purchasing decisions. No matter which barriers prove most important for a given market segment or product, however, businesses must address barriers in all areas before consumers will change their behaviors.\n\nEducate Consumers Because consumers are largely unaware of green alternatives, businesses first need to think of themselves as educators, not salespeople. And they must expand their lesson plans beyond their own products to the larger issues of pollution, climate change, overfishing, and other environmental problems. And nonprofits and government agencies also need to take up the cause of green education.\n\nConsider the success of Energy Star. This program, a joint effort launched by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy in 1992, educates consumers about how energy-efficient products can reduce energy use, save money, and protect the environment. Every product that meets government energy-efficiency standards can carry the Energy Star label, which has gained widespread consumer recognition and trust. Because federal regulations mandated energy labels on certain appliances, almost half of the air conditioners sold in the United States in 2005 carried the Energy Star label. In addition, in 2005, close to 30 percent of all U.S. homes had energy-efficient refrigerators and washing machines, according to the Vermont Department of Public Service.\n\nTo cite another example: Procter & Gamble Co.'s (P&G) \"Future Friendly\" campaign teaches consumers how they can have a positive impact on the environment by making their homes more energy efficient, using less water, and reducing the amount of household waste. Specific tips include washing clothes in cold water and drying them in the air rather than in a dryer. P&G benefits because it refreshes its brand, enhances its reputation, and protects its market share from new environmentally friendly competitors.\n\nBuild Better Products For consumers to improve their opinions of green products, companies must create ones that are equal to, or better than, conventional alternatives. Consumers still value performance, reliability, and durability much more than a product's ecological soundness. Indeed, to overcome their image problem, green products must often outperform their traditional counterparts.\n\nGE managed to do this with the CFLs. The first CFLs cost a lot more, and were harder to find than conventional bulbs. Now, they pay for themselves in five months, and are readily available. Wal-Mart has committed to sell 100 million CFLs in 2008 and displays them prominently on its shelves. CFLs piggybacked on Energy Star's success with the \"Change a Light, Change the World\" campaign. This effort increased awareness of CFLs and resulted in 500,000 pledges to replace a traditional light bulb with an Energy Star CFL.\n\nToyota likewise had to tackle early perceptions that the Prius had less power than non-hybrid cars. Toyota did this by redesigning the Prius to meet performance and style preferences of consumers. The carmaker increased the horsepower and conducted a campaign promoting the vehicle as \"quick, roomy, and economical.\"\n\nBe Honest In recent years, consumers have caught companies red-handed at \"greenwashing\"  that is, claiming that their products are far more environmentally friendly than they actually are. To rebuild public trust, companies must inform the public about their true environmental impact, as well as about their attempts to reduce that impact. Many will need to identify and address specific historical concerns about their products or operations. Only then will consumers believe the company's Earth-sparing claims.\n\nIn 2005, GE launched \"Ecomagination,\" an initiative with the broad objective of meeting environmental challenges such as the need for clean water, renewable energy, and reduced emissions. Ecomagination covered GE's efforts to enhance its investment in sustainable technologies and increase its revenues from sustainable products such as lower-emission aircraft engines, efficient lighting, wind turbines, and water purification technology. As part of the Ecomagination campaign, GE also undertook efforts to make its own operations more environmentally sustainable. One of the results of the program is that GE kept its greenhouse gas emissions flat in 2005, even as revenues rose.\n\nTelling consumers they should act green when the company itself is making little effort to improve its own operations is asking for a backlash. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a U.K. watchdog, received a fourfold increase in complaints about environmental claims in advertisements in 2007.3 One offender, according to ASA, was the low-price airline Ryanair Ltd., which promoted itself as the industry leader in environmental efficiency. In 2007, however, the airline received significant negative press when CEO Michael O'Leary confessed that his claim that the airline had cut emissions of carbon dioxide by half over the past five years was an \"error.\"\n\nOffer More To increase sales of green products, companies must make sure that consumers understand the returns  both financial and environmental  on their investment. When consumers find it easy to track their savings from using a product, they are more willing to try new green products  especially those that cost more. They also feel more confident about their eco-friendly purchases when they understand how the products help the environment.\n\nMany companies participate in Energy Star's voluntary EnergyGuide labeling program. Labels placed on products in retail stores communicate the products' annual energy use (in watts and dollars) and compares it to similar products. Presented in a simple and clear manner, the information helps consumers choose products that not only are energy efficient but also save them money. The Prius's value goes well beyond functionality.\n\nThe Prius caught consumers' imaginations because it had a unique and contemporary style that signaled the owners' commitment to the environment. Its dashboard communicates fuel consumption and energy efficiency, thereby broadcasting the car's environmental benefits. By contrast, Honda Motor Co.'s Accord hybrid, which looked more conventional and did not toot its own environmental horn, languished (and was eventually dropped in 2008). In 2006, Prius held 76 percent of the hybrid market; the Accord hybrid, which functioned just as well as the Prius, held just 12 percent.\n\nBring Products to the People Companies cannot sell their products if consumers cannot find them. It sounds obvious, but many of today's green products are not widely available. Even finding out how to get them is difficult.\n\nWal-Mart and GE have helped make CFLs a successful consumer product by making it easy for consumers to buy them. Wal-Mart put the bulbs in the most coveted place  at eye level on the top two or three shelves. An educational display from GE complements the attractive shelf placement. Toyota communicates its intent to make the Prius widely available by running ads that say: \"We've significantly increased production on the hard-to-find, easy-to-drive Toyota Prius.\" According to AutoInsight, Toyota has increased production of the Prius since 1999 by an average of 50 percent a year.\n\nTHE GREEN IMPERATIVE\n\nBusinesses alone cannot lead consumers from intention to action. In many instances, the government and the civil sector need to be heavily involved to achieve long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. Nevertheless, businesses should play a leading role in the green movement in order to shape their market opportunities and manage potential regulation of their industries.\n\nGreen products and services are only a niche market today, but they are poised for strong growth. Already, 33 percent of consumers say they are willing to pay a premium for green products, and another 54 percent care about the environment and want to help tackle climate change. Entering the green market can also improve companies' reputations, thereby increasing the value of their brands. Some 70 percent to 80 percent of public companies' valuation in American and Western European stock markets depends on expectations of the company's cash flow beyond the next three years. Companies' reputations strongly shape those expectations, and corporate citizenship is the top driver of reputation, according to the Reputation Institute's 2007 global survey.\n\nIn addition, firms that have a strong position in the green market can stay ahead of regulation and protect their market share from competitors. More than 80 percent of 2,192 executives surveyed by The McKinsey Quarterly about climate change expect some form of climate change regulation within the next five years in countries where their companies operate.5European countries already have limits on carbon emissions through the Kyoto Protocol, and a number of U.S. states have established similar systems. More than 600 mayors from around the world have committed their cities to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe most proactive companies will lead regulation, and may even push for stricter regulations that will put their less environmentally savvy competitors at a disadvantage. Newcomers, in turn, can steal market share from existing companies by appealing to the growing legions of green consumers. Whole Foods Market Inc., with its double-digit sales growth in the essentially flat supermarket industry, is a powerful example of a new entrant that is not only winning market share with a green and ethical offering, but also taking share in the premium segment of the market.\n\nCompanies may rightly ask whether cultivating green consumers is worth all the trouble. We believe that it is not only worth the trouble, but also imperative for success. Once businesses remove the obstacles between consumers' desire to buy green and the actual follow-through of those sentiments, green products could experience explosive sales growth. What's more, building a reputation as an Earth-friendly corporation can do much more than generate increased revenues from green products. The better a company's reputation, the more talented the employees it can attract, the more loyalty it can inspire in its customers, and the more it can charge for its products.\n\nConsumers say they want to buy ecologically friendly products and reduce their impact on the environment. But when they get to the cash register, their Earth-minded sentiments die on the vine. Although individual quirks underlie some of this hypocrisy, businesses can do a lot more to help would-be green consumers turn their talk into walk.",

        "title":"Governing the Biosphere Economy",
        "content":"In 1492 Christopher Columbus landed on what he thought were the shores of India  except he had discovered a new continent. The \"business case\" he presented to lure his funders was based on a gross miscalculation of the diameter of the Earth, but this mistake led him and his reluctant investors  among them the court of Isabella I of Castile  to a serendipitous success.\n\nIn 2010, the planet has shrunk dramatically. In just five hundred years, we have moved from a world of few people, uncertainty about the proportions of the planet, and virtually unlimited resources to a world of strained ecological limits, population pressures, and climate change induced by growth models that date back to the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBut astonishing new insights are emerging from cutting-edge science. In 2009, the Stockholm Resilience Centre identified ten \"planetary boundaries\" that make up the safe operating space for humanity (with climate change being just one), showing that we have already crossed the stability threshold for two of them  the loss of biodiversity and the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous in the Earth's cycles.[1] The poor will be hit first and hardest, as the tipping points in ecological stability affect the production of food and energy and the availability of water and land, and reinforce extreme temperatures and weather events.\n\nWe are only beginning to understand the critical interdependence between the economy, the biosphere, and human security. Take the Amazon rainforest, which pumps eight trillion tons of water a year into the atmosphere, regulating rainfall from South America to Tibet. Deforestation in the Amazon will generate acute water shortages in Brazil (to take one example), whose energy supply is 70 percent dependent on hydropower. But little of this has made it to the central debate on deforestation and sustainability in the Amazon. Why not?\n\nGoverning for the long term\n\nEven with the stark evidence before us, as was the case in Copenhagen's COP15 summit, it is unclear whether governments, investors, and businesses can act at the speed that is required. This \"governance gap\" is not new: 2,300 years ago, in ancient Greece, Aristotle was already picking up that \"what is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care.\"[2]\n\nPeople acting independently of one another have an incentive to deplete common resources even if it is crystal clear that the outcome is in no one's long-term interest. From fisheries to aquifers and forests, today this so-called \"tragedy of the commons\" is being played out on a planetary scale. Our political systems, modeled on the ancient Greek idea of governance, remain poorly equipped to deal effectively with the management of our long-term interest.\n\nZoom into a different region: East Africa. In Tanzania over 90 percent of the population today depends on burning wood charcoal for cooking. The rural poor produce it as a source of income by cutting down the forest. Overall this market claims more than three hundred hectares of forest a day and is worth over $650 million a year. Kenya has already lost over 80 percent of its original forest cover. The reduction in rainfall and the loss of natural temperature and humidity control mechanisms continue to have substantial financial and development costs for its population.\n\nEntrepreneurial solutions in Tanzania, such as Joint Environmental Techniques, have proved that charcoal briquettes can be easily made from agricultural waste, providing jobs and avoiding deforestation (www.arti-africa.org/charcoal.html). But the market infrastructure is lacking in comparison to that for wood charcoal, which has well-wired distribution channels and the patronage of local politicians. Thinking in terms of infrastructure is key to system change.\n\nEnter Elinor Ostrom, who in 2009 was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for Economics for showing that it is possible for groups that use common resources to successfully manage them  without government regulation or privatization.[3] Among the requirements is the formal recognition by governments of the authority of self-organizing communities and the creation of clear rules and accountability among the users involved. These experiments in governance illustrate the necessity of mainstreaming new forms of collaboration to manage long-term issues.\n\nFrom experiments to system change\n\nMany of the contributors to this issue of Alliance magazine highlight the limitations of thinking \"incrementally\" about social change. They see a need for social investors to move beyond growing organizations or replicating programs to tackle the fundamentals of systems: the governance of institutions, markets, and economies.\n\nJust as the French Revolution laid the basis for new ways of organizing individual rights and freedoms, our century will be defined by experiments to reboot economic governance so that issues like transparency, sustainability of the biosphere, and equity become central aspects of business- and politics-as-usual.\n\nThe funding community is picking up the signal, too. Volans and Alliance conducted a survey among members of the European Foundation Centre, the European Venture Philanthropy Association, the Council on Foundations and the PRI Makers Network in the U.S. Of over seventy foundations that participated in the survey, 90 percent said that creating a large-scale impact through their work is important in their investment strategies. More importantly, 70 percent think that the issue of scale will become more important for their foundations in the next five years.\n\nIf these issues are already, at least to some extent, on the radar screens of social investors and foundations, what type of agenda will be relevant to their strategies and programs in the next five to ten years?\n\nAn orderly revolution\n\nIn 1202, Leonardo of Pisa introduced the \"Fibonacci sequence\" to Western mathematics. This is a sequence of numbers that form a spiral shape and whose proportions, it was then found, underpinned the design of a surprising number of natural forms: the curve of waves, the shape of some shells, the coiling of plant offshoots, the shape of spiraling galaxies, and even the proportions of the human skeleton, among others.\n\nHumans have already, knowingly or not, borrowed this sequence for designing physical infrastructures, like spiral staircases. A question we explored in this issue is whether we can also learn from nature about how to create other types of infrastructure  social, political, and economic  which can be best fitted to the governance of our long-term interests.\n\nIn this issue, Geoffrey West, a theoretical physicist and distinguished professor at the Santa Fe Institute, shares his insight on universal scaling laws in physics and biology, and how these are being applied to social organizations. In his work, West has found a constant equation in how most living organisms develop and scale. This is because all living organisms share a \"universal property of networks\": the infrastructures that distribute nutrients and energy throughout their systems, and which enable phenomenal economies of scale.\n\nFollowing this cue, other contributors to this issue of Alliance present a view of how new relationships, partnerships, and networks can move particular solutions closer to a system-level intervention. Looking across the articles, the contributions can be organized into three broad themes where investments in \"infrastructures for scale\" are of critical importance.\n\nSocial infrastructures. For a foundation or social investor, a social movement can look chaotic, unpredictable, and prone to political risk. The experience of the AVINA Foundation in supporting Brazil's National Movement of Street Waste Pickers, as well as the insights from South Africa's Informal Settlement Network, provide compelling stories about the importance of building social networks where people self-organize to address problems and opportunities arising from issues like waste and housing.\n\nThe contributions by Oscar Fergutz of AVINA and Benjamin Bradlow of the Informal Settlement Network show that funders can act as brokers who level the playing field for these movements and provide access to other funders, as well as businesses and governments, helping them find opportunities to align their strategies in support of social infrastructures on the ground. Social movements provide one of the most powerful bases through which social investors and governments can invest in creating social capital.\n\nInstitutional infrastructures. Traditional institutions are failing to provide the space for effective cross-sector collaboration. The support of the Gates Foundation to partnerships like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) illustrates some of the new institutional vehicles that are being created to overcome those limitations and support government delivery in new ways. Following from the Gates Foundation's $10 billion commitment to develop and deliver vaccines worldwide, the interview with Jeff Raikes provides further thinking on how to govern these global institutions to avoid creating new global bureaucracies. The interview with Richard Branson, on the other hand, illustrates how Virgin Unite Virgin Unite is helping create new and nimble \"global hubs\" like the Carbon War Room to accelerate action by brokering the much-needed collaboration between entrepreneurs, investors, business, and governments.\n\nNancy Kete's article on EMBARQ, the World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport, explains how EMBARQ has helped leverage over $800 million in private investment for sustainable transport, as well as the pioneering role that the Shell Foundation has had in creating the initiative. Today EMBARQ is working in some of the world's most challenging cities, like Istanbul, Delhi, and Mexico City, and finding ways to pool political will, technical expertise, and investment to address transport problems. But it is also in itself an institutional innovation as a global network that links these cities and their solutions together to create global critical mass.\n\nMarket infrastructures. The phenomenal success of Skype created a welcome disruption of the mainstream market for long-distance calls, which is resulting in lower prices by larger telecom companies. Niklas Zennstrm, co-founder of Skype, reflects on how he is using the lessons learned from this success to inform the strategy of his social investment fund. Through his work he seeks to pull \"market levers\" that can bring about larger changes in the economy. One example is his efforts to attract pension funds to invest in low-carbon innovation.\n\nIqbal Quadir, founder of Grameenphone in Bangladesh, talks about the market infrastructures needed to unleash innovation and how his work at the MIT Legatum Center aims to contribute to that. Anthony Bugg-Levine of the Rockefeller Foundation thinks that growing the \"impact investment\" community will require a market infrastructure similar to that in the venture capital market, which can redirect capital flows on a larger scale. Market infrastructures on the ground are also critical, and the articles about VisionSpring's experience in Bangladesh and Femina HIP's in Tanzania both demonstrate the importance of leveraging networks, such as distribution partnerships, to create momentum to scale good business model ideas.\n\nPathways to Scale\n\nAt Volans, we are exploring these questions further, framed with a simple five-stage model of change. Stages 1, 2, and 3 cover the \"Eureka!\" moment for ideas and solutions; the early \"Experiments\" and prototypes that follow; and the \"Enterprises\" that are built  and invested in  as a result.\n\nStage 4 looks beyond single enterprises to the building of \"Ecosystems,\" where creative partnerships and alliances assemble new infrastructures for scale that can rewire the governance of markets and institutions, building momentum for system change in Stage 5, the \"Economy.\" For more information: www.volans.com/pathways\n\nAn important element of this agenda is the creation and dissemination of new blueprints for collaborative action, which signal opportunities for business, investors, governments, and entrepreneurs to work together to assemble the social, market, and institutional \"infrastructures for scale\" that are needed.\n\nOne of the projects in which we are pursuing this is 'The Biosphere Economy', with the support of the Tellus Mater Foundation. Here we explore the market revolution ignited by the global ecological overshoot, and how business, investors, and governments can work with innovators and entrepreneurs to change the way they view and manage natural capital (www.biosphereeconomy.com).\n\nThe project is working with particular innovators and their stakeholders, from Tanzania to Brazil. One example is Mathis Wackernagel of the Global Footprint Network, with whom we are exploring how their ideas might be taken up and furthered by governments around the world.\n\nAs part of this agenda, I was recently involved in designing and helping to lead an international \"learning journey\" to the Ecuadorean Amazon, in partnership with the Tllberg Foundation and AVINA Foundation. The trip brought together an international group of scientists, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and government stakeholders to explore how solutions to deforestation  from new satellite monitoring initiatives to regional networks of eco-journalists  can make a dent in the markets and institutions that govern the Amazon.[4] The challenges and the opportunities to help these solutions change the governance of the Amazon speak directly to the relevance of the different contributions in this issue of Alliance.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSome of today's changemakers undoubtedly identify with Christopher Columbus's spirit and appetite for risk. Beyond their \"Eureka\" moments, their \"Experiments\" double-guess and test the shortcuts to success, while their \"Enterprises\" open new frontiers, even if it is with imperfect tools and limited resources and market intelligence.[5]\n\nThe French Revolution and most of the subsequent revolutionary experiments of the 20th century were violent mobilizations from below, aimed at toppling the elites that governed them. Today, the challenge is to grow more effective forms of governance that can manage markets, institutions, and social capital more intelligently.\n\nSome of the solutions to these problems already exist, at least in embryonic form. The collection of articles and interviews in this issue of Alliance suggests that in order to take those ideas to scale, a new generation of high-impact investors, unafraid of politics, will need to have an appetite and freedom to take bold risks, informed by cutting-edge science, which attempt to redefine the basic rules and patterns that govern our economy. The good news is that these pioneering investors are already out there, and the revolution might be under way.\n\n_______\n\n1 The \"planetary boundaries\" research was published in Johan Rockstrom, Will Steffen, Kevin Noone et al, \"A Safe Operating Space for Humanity\", Nature, 23 September 2009.\n\n2 Aristotle, Politics: Book III.\n\n3 Elinor Ostrom (1990) Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action, Cambridge University Press.\n\n4 The 'Amazon Learning Journey' was part of the Tllberg Foundation's Whence & Wither Project: www.tallbergfoundation.org\n\n5 On the logic of the Christopher Columbus discovery, see Umberto Eco (2000) Serendipity: Language and Lunacy, Phoenix.\n\nAlejandro Litovsky is Director of Pathways to Scale at Volans, a group advancing the business of social innovation.

Grantmakers in the Arts also works to increase the presence of arts philanthropy within the broader philanthropic community and helps individual arts grantmakers increase their effectiveness and capacity.\n\n\nBackground:\nThe ideas that guide arts grantmakers reflect a wide range of purposes  from furthering a specific art form to expanding the understanding of how art contributes to society and community life. Founded in 1985, GIA is the only national organization that focuses solely on philanthropy in arts and culture. It primarily serves private sector arts grantmakers and provides a forum for open and forthright discussions aimed at improving arts grantmaking skills and practices.\n\nGIA is a nonprofit membership organization comprised of private foundations, family foundations, community foundations, corporate foundations, corporate giving programs, individuals, and nonprofit organizations that provide arts grants. GIA also welcomes public sector grantmakers as affiliate members. Overall, more than 1,200 individuals  both trustees and staff members  participate in GIA, representing more than 300 organizations.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nMembership in GIA includes a subscription to the annual members directory, networking opportunities at GIA-sponsored events, and access to research on foundation arts and culture grants. Members also receive a subscription to the GIA Reader, which features articles by artists, cultural critics, historians, and grantmakers on topics of interest to arts grantmakers and others. The publication also includes summaries of recent reports and studies, book reviews, and regional and interest-specific reports on arts grantmaking.\n\nAnother benefit of membership is the advance notice and reduced registration fees for GIA's annual conference. The 2002 conference, Creative Connections, will be held in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 28-30. The theme for the conference emerged in response to a key goal of GIA's strategic plan  to reach beyond a strictly defined definition of arts grantmaking and form alliances with other areas of philanthropy. Conference programs will reveal the natural connections between arts and other fields with special focus on community building, education, environment, and smart growth.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe GIA Web site is a gateway to a solid collection of research in the field of arts grantmaking. The site provides summaries of several reports and studies that can be ordered from GIA. One significant report, Learning and the Arts: Crossing Boundaries (36 pages, PDF), can be downloaded in its entirety from the site. The report is the result of a meeting organized by the J. Paul Getty Trust, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation that brought together 120 funding professionals from the arts; education; or children, youth, and family programs of fifty foundations. The foundation staff members worked with researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore the value philanthropy can add to education and child development by integrating the arts into schools and non-school programs.\n\n\nFunding:\nGIA is supported by its membership base of more than 300 and nearly seventy funding partners.",

        "title":"Meet The Composer",
        "content":"Mission:\nTo increase opportunities for composers by fostering the creation, performance, dissemination, and appreciation of their music.\n\n\nBackground:\nAccomplished composer John Duffy established Meet The Composer in 1974 as a project of the New York State Council on the Arts to raise the profile of the profession and help composers make a living writing music. With a budget of $54,000, the organization launched its first program  the Meet The Composer Fund  to enable composers to participate actively in performances of their work through performing, conducting, speaking with audiences, presenting workshops, giving interviews, and coaching rehearsals. MTC has expanded over the years, working with thousands of artistic and civic organizations, to help provide new music in rural communities, small towns, suburban centers, and urban neighborhoods nationwide. It has supported projects ranging from major symphonic pieces and full-length operas to works for jazz ensemble and music for theater projects. At the same time, MTC has revolutionized the environment for composers by creating new opportunities and establishing broadly accepted standards of payment.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nIn addition to the Meet The Composer Fund, the organization operates several other programs that support the creation of new work, direct contact between composers and audiences, collaborations among composers and other artists, and educational programs focused on composing. Its New Residencies program brings together performing organizations, such as orchestras, jazz ensembles, and theater companies, and community-based organizations, including neighborhood centers, schools, and churches, to work with a resident composer for three years. In addition to writing pieces that celebrate local culture, the composer teaches, organizes cultural events, and promotes local heritage. Another MTC residency program, Music Alive, allows orchestras of all sizes to recruit a composer to help prepare for the performance of his or her work.\n\nOther MTC programs include Compose Yourself, which taps the expertise of composers for the development and implementation of music in K-12 curriculum. Finally, the Commissioning Music/USA program, which is a joint project of MTC and the National Endowment for the Arts, supports nonprofit performing and presenting organizations that wish to commission new works.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nMTC is frequently recognized for the excellence of its programs. It has received the New York State Governor's Award, the Business Committee for the Arts Award, the Arts and Business Council's Encore Award, and the American Symphony Orchestra League's prestigious Gold Baton Award.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nIn addition to providing information about its programs, the MTC Web site includes interviews with composers who have worked with the organization, audio files of their music, and links to various composers' Web sites and music and arts groups nationwide. The site also features Commissioning Music: A Basic Guide (4 pages, PDF) and applications for various programs, including Commissioning Music/USA (16 pages, PDF), which must be submitted to MTC by January 15, 2003, for consideration next year.\n\n\nFunding:\nMTC receives support from many foundations, corporations, individual patrons, and government sources, including the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Target Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.",

        "title":"The Advertising Council, Inc.",
        "content":"Mission:\nTo identify a select number of significant public issues and stimulate action on those issues through communications programs that make a measurable difference in society.\n\n\nBackground:\nThe Ad Council is a nonprofit organization with a sixty-year history of marshalling volunteer talent from the advertising and media industries to deliver critical messages to the American public. Since creating the category of public service advertisements (PSAs) in 1942, the organization has played an increasingly critical role in our changing society. Founded as the War Advertising Council to rally support for World War II-related efforts, the Ad Council's earliest achievements included campaigns such as \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" and \"Rosie the Riveter.\" After the war, President Roosevelt asked the War Ad Council to continue as a peacetime organization to help solve the most pressing issues of the day.\n\nThe Ad Council has created timely and compelling public service messages for generations of Americans. Ad Council icons and slogans are woven into the very fabric of American culture from Smokey Bear's \"Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires\" and McGruff the Crime Dog's \"Take A Bite Out of Crime\" to the United Negro College Fund's \"A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" and \"Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk.\"\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nThe Ad Council's current campaign docket consists of approximately forty national campaigns sponsored by nonprofit organizations or government agencies. The campaigns address issues ranging from environmental preservation to colorectal cancer awareness to the prevention of child abuse.\n\nIn 1995, the Ad Council adopted a ten-year initiative to help Americans who can't speak for themselves  children. Dubbed \"Commitment 2000,\" its objective is to raise awareness and stimulate individuals to take positive action, so that U.S. children will have a better chance of achieving their full potential.\n\nIn addition, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Ad Council returned to its wartime footing to communicate critical messages to Americans just as it had during World War II. PSAs such as \"I am an American\" helped the nation to embrace its diversity and unite in the wake of the terrorist attacks. Shortly thereafter, the Ad Council announced its \"Campaign for Freedom,\" an initiative representing the advertising industry, to oversee the development of PSA campaigns that would continue to inform, involve, and inspire the American people.\n\nThe Ad Council also holds a seminar series every two years in an effort to share its best kept secrets of public service advertising with the nonprofit community, government agencies, and communications professionals. Initiated in 2000, the seminar provides information about the components of developing effective public service communications, including research, marketing, media outreach, and the evaluation of campaign results. The 2003 Ad Council Seminar Series will take place on May 8-9, 2003, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nThe Ad Council's public service advertising campaigns are more than memorable  they raise awareness, inspire individuals to take action, and save lives. Smokey Bear has helped reduce the acreage of land lost annually to forest fires from 22 million to 4 million, and since the Drunk Driving Prevention campaign was launched in 1983, 70 percent of Americans have tried to stop someone from driving drunk. The Crash Test Dummies, Vince and Larry, have helped increase seat belt usage from 21 percent to 73 percent since 1985, saving an estimated 75,000 lives. And since the United Negro College Fund campaign began thirty years ago, more than $1.9 billion has been raised, helping hundreds of thousands of minority students to graduate from college. Additionally, the media industry continues to increase its donations of valuable advertising time and space to Ad Council campaigns. In 2001, total donated media was valued at more than $1.5 billion, exceeding $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe Ad Council's Web site serves as a comprehensive resource for information on some of the nation's most critical social issues, and in doing so, it extends the organization's public service messages. Recognizing the increasing importance of the Internet as a resource for information and a tool for social change, the Ad Council re-launched its site in 2002 with a new design and additional content intended for a wide range of users.\n\n\nFunding:\nAs a private, nonprofit organization, the Ad Council receives general operating contributions from more than 375 individuals, corporations, foundations, and constituent organizations.",

Founded in 1980, the Holiday Project brightens the lives of institutionalized people by recruiting visitors who want to volunteer during the holidays. The organization is led by one employee, a part-time executive director, and a volunteer board of directors.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nIn thirty-one cities across the United States, the Holiday Project organizes visitors by coordinating with selected institutions, training team leaders, and recruiting volunteers. The teams spend at least a few hours at each institution to make sure residents understand that people want to visit them during the holidays.\n\nThe Holiday Project also encourages youth to become volunteers. It organizes school classes to make greeting cards and delivers them to residents in institutions. Its Adopt-A-Home project helps teachers and others who work with children and adolescents organize visits to nursing homes. Potential participants can sign up at the Holiday Project's Web site to receive a kit to get started on their adoption project.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nLast year, the Holiday Project posted its volunteer opportunities on the VolunteerMatch Web site, which generated more than 650 inquiries to visit institutions. The group hopes to continue attracting new visitors online and has encouraged its local branches to register their visits at the site.\n\n\nWeb site:\nThe Web site of the Holiday Project offers a number of ways to participate, including visiting, organizing volunteer visitor teams, and wrapping gifts, and provides instructions for setting up and managing visits. The site also connects potential volunteers with local leaders through its directory, which has contact information for team leaders across the U.S.\n\n\nFunding:\nFunds to operate the Holiday Project are raised at the local level and are supplemented by several national fundraising events.

The report is the first major project of Equity Action, which was established in 2002 by the Rhode Island Foundation in response to a challenge from the National Lesbian and Gay Community Funding Partnership, which promised to contribute $100,000 to Equity Action's fund for nonprofits that serve LGBT communities if the foundation raised $200,000 for the effort. To date, the foundation has raised $85,000 toward that goal, with at least $25,000 more in pledges.",

It is the first and only major federal legislation promoting tax-qualified retirement saving for moderate- and lower-income workers: The rate of government contributions per dollar of private contributions falls as household incomes rise. For example, the saver's credit applies to contributions of up to $2,000 per year per individual; the credit rate is 50 percent for married taxpayers with incomes up to $30,000; it then declines and is not available at all for those with incomes of $50,000 or above. A policy brief of the Brookings Institution, Improving the Saver's Credit (8 pages, PDF), suggests that the saver's credit could be strengthened by making it permanent and refundable (which it is not at the present time), and expanding it to provide more powerful incentives for a substantial number of middle-class households. These changes, the brief states, would help lower- and middle-income families save for retirement, reduce economic insecurity and poverty rates among the elderly, and raise national saving. Unfortunately, only about half of workers participate in an employer-based pension plan in any given year, and those who do rarely make the maximum allowable contributions. Participation rates in IRAs are substantially lower.",

        "title":"Being the Only B",
        "content":"Being the only one of something  whatever that something is  generally has one of two results. Either it makes you hot stuff or it backfires. In business, you hope for the first. It's supply and demand at its finest: less of you increases the desire for you. But move away from theory and into practice, and real life may not always work that way. Sometimes being the only one of something means that fewer people understand you or realize what you truly have to offer. Instead of becoming rare, you become an anomaly  the product people aren't quite sure what to do with, an outcast.\n\nI am the owner of In Every Language, Kentucky's only certified B Corporation. Not only are we the only B in Kentucky, which means we've been certified as a socially responsible business, we're the only B in our industry. So if anybody understands what it's like to be the only one of something in business, it's me.\n\nEven before certification, In Every Language was a social enterprise. Based in Louisville, In Every Language provides translating, interpreting, and other language services to clients around the world. That's the business part of what we do. When it comes to the social part, we do two different things.\n\nFirst, the community nature of translation is inherent. Translators take what one person says and translate it into another language, so another person can understand. Without translators, information wouldn't pass correctly between cultures and countries, international misunderstandings would develop, and wars could start. The American Translators Association claims that it takes less time to train a fighter pilot than it takes to train an Arabic interpreter, and the interpreter is more important to national security.\n\nOn a less alarming note, community interpreters help patients understand their course of care and help immigrants obtain access to community services. Both translators and interpreters provide access to information and knowledge that the language barrier blocked before. Being a translator automatically means being a helper. The sheer fact that In Every Language is a translation provider automatically integrates social cause into our business because, regardless of the message translated, social benefit lies in the act of translating itself.\n\nFor me, though, this wasn't enough. Although the translation industry is replete with social benefit, not every translation company is a social enterprise. In Every Language is the industry's only certified B Corporation for a reason: we do translation differently.\n\nTackling Two Global Problems at Once\n\nWhen I started the company in 2005, I wanted a full-time job that mattered. I was already freelancing as an interpreter at Kentucky Refugee Ministries, working with Louisville's Francophone African population. Interpreting gave me a life. Any other job I took seemed fruitless, without soul. It was only when I was interpreting that I felt fully alive, as if I were using a gift from God to benefit others. While interpreting, I disappeared and became a catalyst for change. The tremendous help that translating and interpreting affords others is why I opened In Every Language. I realized not only that refugees and immigrants need interpreters, but that there is also an abundance of bilingual, trained professionals who need jobs.\n\nEnter Translation Plus Two, In Every Language's unique approach to translation and the second part of our social mission. Our company slogan is Translating Words, Transforming Lives, because we're trying to help solve two global problems at once: the language barrier and world poverty.\n\nIn addition to providing translation services, we contract 100 percent of our translators from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, such as refugees, people from undeveloped or underdeveloped countries, and women from cultures where they are not allowed to work outside the home. We also help these contractors become certified translators and grow their own translation microbusinesses.\n\nI had hoped that fighting poverty and the language barrier would be a bandwagon everyone would want to get on, but not in Kentucky  or at least not at first. Immediately after we opened the company, some people at Kentucky nonprofits turned against In Every Language. The director of one resettlement agency accused me of trying to take advantage of poor refugees for personal gain. This hurt. How could offering professional work to someone who needs and deserves it be considered taking advantage?\n\nIt didn't take long to understand what she meant. She didn't really think I was taking advantage of refugees; she thought I was profiting from them. In Every Language is the first for-profit language service provider to contract members of Kentucky's refugee population. I am not Kentucky's first social entrepreneur, but I was definitely the first one she had ever met.\n\nSince then, In Every Language has had to prove itself repeatedly. We turn six in August 2011, and I still find myself explaining social entrepreneurship and why it's important. Ironically, social entrepreneurship is a fundamental part of Kentucky culture, as our state's history is agrarian and community-based. But Kentuckians have never called their efforts social enterprises, and even though community farms may be the most elemental type of social enterprise there is, most small farmers don't think of themselves as businessmen. To them, businessmen are like J.R. Ewing  ruthless and in suits, not everyday working people. The people who lead organized social enterprise movements unfortunately have done little to dispel this stereotype. Their marketing and certification efforts have focused on the coasts, with B Lab in particular certifying 108 B Corps in California compared to one each in Iowa, Kansas, Idaho, and Kentucky.\n\nFortunately, the hostility in Louisville's nonprofit community has gone away, and Kentucky's refugee resettlement agencies and other community organizations have come to see In Every Language as a partner. We team up to interpret mayoral debates and work together on making interpreter training more accessible to those considering translating or interpreting as a career.\n\nB Corporation certification helped resolve some of these public relations problems. In particular, the status has helped differentiate us from for-profits that focus solely on their bottom line. Our actions have earned us respect, but being a B has earned us understanding. We describe it to people like this: B Corp is a national movement, but the commonwealth of Kentucky has yet to recognize it as a legal filing status, so we're filed as an LLC for now. We're allowed to keep our money, but legally we're bound to a mission just like nonprofits.\n\nThe CSR Disconnect\n\nEven though In Every Language helps the economically disadvantaged, we like to sell to those a bit better off: the Fortune Global 500. After all, for a for-profit business to be sustainable, it has to make money. We earn revenues by selling translation and interpreting. Although many smaller businesses or local nonprofits may need those services, it's big businesses that are able to pay for them. So we market ourselves to the Johnson & Johnsons of the world, which are not located in Kentucky.\n\nYou'd think that being a social enterprise would give us a competitive edge with this market. Unfortunately, when those responsible for purchasing translation hear social enterprise, many think nonprofit. When they think nonprofit, they think unprofessional or no good. In the world of professional language services, quality is king. One mistranslated word in factory instructions and workers could chop off their hands. A misinterpreted phrase in a doctor's appointment notes could lead to death. Our work is important and we must do it well. Say refugee, impoverished, or discriminated population loud enough and some potential clients question quality. In fact, one even said: You need to drop this B Corp thing. No one understands what it is and it makes you look like amateurs.\n\nWhen we first became a B, I thought the certification would help. The big plan was to sell our services to socially responsible corporations through their CSR departments. But at many businesses, there's a disconnect between those responsible for CSR and those contracting for translation services. The CSR officers I meet love our model, but most have no idea who at their company is in charge of translation. Even when they do, the actual translation buyer must still be swayed. It takes considerable work to convince buyers that our translators are of the utmost quality. In fact, because of the stigma that arises from their backgrounds, I'd say they're better than translators at other companies where quality isn't immediately questioned. Our translators are highly experienced, degreed, and certified. When we come across less qualified translators, we refer them to competitors whose quality standards are less strict. This way, they can gain the experience needed to work with our clients. In the end, our quality procedures must be stricter because of the stigma against our translators' backgrounds. Still, being the industry's only B has hurt us.\n\nWe have a solution, though: We're banking on people caring. Maybe Translation Plus Two isn't the right fit for every customer, but not every customer is the right fit for us. Again, we're looking for people who care. We're looking for customers who get excited by the fact that a Somali woman can grow her translation business while still respecting her husband's wish that she not work outside her home. We're looking for customers who love that their Bosnian interpreter has a success story, that he first learned how to interpret professionally while working in the camps for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These are the clients we want to work for. These are the people whose materials we're proud to translate.\n\nWe're not perfect. No person or company is. But In Every Language has a strong mission and a clear sense of its corporate and social identity. Our staff is determined. We'd rather be the only B than not be a B at all. Because being a B means that you as a customer have proof that our mission is not just self-serving. We want to be held accountable.\n\nTerena Bell is CEO of In Every Language, a certified B Corporation located in Louisville, KY. Her work with the company has been recognized by two Kentucky governors, and she has both spoken and published internationally on translation industry topics.\n\nThe owner of the only certified B Corporation in Kentucky assesses the pros and cons of the certification....",

        "title":"The Power of Money",
        "content":"Six months after I had started working for the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, a close friend said to me, \"You have changed  you expect people to listen to you.\" It was a good reminder of the best piece of advice I received on getting the job: Eric Adams, of the Barrow Cadbury Trust, had told me, \"Keep your feet on the ground and you will be all right.\"\n\nIt is difficult to keep your feet on the ground when working in a foundation because you are inevitably placed in a position of power. When meeting grant applicants I was always conscious that for them the meeting could mean someone's job was at stake. With money comes power. And, as the saying goes, power corrupts. As time went on, I grew more accustomed to living with that power, but I also grew increasingly uncomfortable with some of the manifestations of the power relationships that philanthropy engenders. There are many sides to this topic. It's good to be able to explore some of them, both positive and negative.\n\nIt is not often that foundations talk about the power of money. One time it did happen was in 1988 when JRCT's endowment more than doubled following the takeover of the Rowntree company. This provoked a fascinating debate among the trustees. The debate was basically about power. Some trustees welcomed the fact that the foundation had doubled in size and were comfortable with the increased power this brought. Others felt that the trust already had significant resources; they suggested splitting the increased endowment in two so that a new and possibly younger group of trustees could have the chance to try different ways to achieve the social change for which all were striving. The outcome was perhaps inevitable: once given power, it is hard to give it up. The endowment remained intact and the debate was soon forgotten.\n\nOf course, foundations wield many different forms of power....But what they have in common is the power of controlling money. JRCT remains a medium-sized foundation, but the debate within JRCT does raise an important question. Can foundations grow too powerful? The questions that have been posed about the four trustees of the Gates Foundation wielding such immense power are not likely to go away. In fact, it is likely that philanthropy in general will come under increasing scrutiny in the years to come.\n\nWho Holds Power Within Foundations?\n\nResearch in 2005 by the Carnegie UK Trust suggested that foundation boards wield great power and that this is often the reason why foundations are not more adventurous in tackling injustice. A more recent study has suggested that the position is more complex, and that boards do not have to be a drag on creative foundation executives. One lesson that came through strong and clear from the \"From Good to Great\" session at the 2013 European Foundation Centre conference in Copenhagen was that the most effective foundations are likely to be ones where leadership is shared throughout the organization, from a highly engaged board to enduring executive teams and a staff team with ambition for the cause and a blend of humility and professional will. It is a challenge to build this kind of inclusive approach within an organization that wields real power.\n\nPhilanthropy and Inequality\n\nThe power that philanthropy wields touches on the theme that has made me most uncomfortable in recent years: it has become increasingly obvious that philanthropy thrives at times of inequality. This was as true for in the early 20th-century as it is for what some are now describing as the second golden age of philanthropy. A century ago, Seebohm Rowntree faced the embarrassing discovery through his pioneering research on poverty that some of the workers in his own family's company (part-owned by its foundations) were paid insufficient wages to keep them out of poverty. After a generation of relative equality in the second half of the 20th century, in the Global North at least, we are now back facing the very same dilemma  and at a time when philanthropy is growing once again.\n\nAnd yet for many, perhaps most, of us working in philanthropy, promoting social justice and a more equal society is our raison d'tre. There is now research, some funded by philanthropy, which shows that more equal societies are better places to live, even for the wealthy. I wouldn't be so concerned that philanthropy is growing more influential if we could demonstrate that it has the capacity to make a real difference in tackling inequality. There is no doubt that philanthropy can play an important role in showing ways out of problems of social injustice. The problem is that it is beyond philanthropy's capacity to make the kind of structural changes to society that will be needed to make a real difference. These can be achieved only through the power of the state, often in response to demands created by an active civil society supported by philanthropy. Michael Edwards made this point in a 2008 article in openDemocracy:\n\nOver the last century, far more has been achieved by governments committed to equality and justice, and social movements strong enough to force change through, and the same might well be true in the future. No great social cause was mobilized through the market in the 20th century. The civil rights movement, the women's movement, the environmental movement, the New Deal, and the Great Society  all were pushed ahead by civil society and anchored in the power of government as a force for the public good....\n\nThe Role of a Strong State\n\nA strong and independent civil society is often dependent on philanthropy, and this in turn is most effective when there is a strong and courageous state to interact with. At the moment, we are missing the latter, and, sadly in our age of globalized economic power, there are few signs of this changing any time soon. While the economy has gone global, our governments have remained national and local and have struggled to keep up. The issue of taxation demonstrates well the problems caused by this development. It is now estimated that over half of world trade passes through tax havens. Companies in which foundations are invested, and which often operate their own philanthropic arms, are engaged in all kinds of practices designed to lower their tax liabilities. Tax is never a popular subject and yet it is tax that provides the glue which holds societies together. The power of the state is weakened when its tax base is eroded. The Tax Justice Network is an excellent example of the kind of challenging civil society organization that can raise issues and create change. Its campaigning has put the issues of tax havens and corporate tax evasion on the global agenda. TJN has been supported by foundations, but in his challenging article, Richard Murphy takes the logic of TJN's argument beyond the corporate sector to look more carefully at whether philanthropy itself is flourishing partly at the expense of building the capacity of the state and other actors to make the real changes that are needed if our aim is to promote a more just and equal society.\n\nTJN has always suggested that the Millennium Development Goals would be met within two years if multinational corporations paid taxes in the countries of the Global South in which they do business instead of siphoning off the profits via tax havens. There is a growing interest in Africa and the power of multinational corporations in relation to tax justice issues. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Africa is also the continent where the debate about power and philanthropy has to date been articulated most clearly, particularly within the discourse of the African Grantmakers Network.\n\nPhilanthropy and Civil Society\n\nThis leads us to the bigger questions of power relationships between foundations and the organizations they support. Here I have to state where I am coming from. I was really grateful to Luc Tayart de Borms for his description of the different styles of philanthropy practiced within Europe in his book Foundations: Creating Impact In a Globalised World. This gave me an explanation of the conundrum I faced as I started to become involved in philanthropy at the pan-European level. The more I engaged with philanthropy beyond the borders of the UK, the more Anglo-Saxon I felt in my approach. I have to apologize to those who view philanthropy differently, but for me the strongest justification for philanthropy is that it plays a different role to that of either the state or the market. It is about supporting a strong civil society to act as a counterweight to the state, to strengthen our democracies both by demonstrating innovative approaches, and by holding the state to account. These are some of the characteristics that Luc ascribes to the Anglo-Saxon style of philanthropy.\n\nAt its best, this kind of role in supporting and facilitating civil society can be transformative, as Michael Edwards writes in the same openDemocracy article:\n\nThe best philanthropy does deliver tangible outputs like jobs, health care, and houses, but more importantly it changes the social and political dynamics of places in ways that enable whole communities to share in the fruits of innovation and success. Key to these successes has been the determination to change power relations and the ownership of assets and put poor and other marginalized people firmly in the driving seat, and that's no accident. This is why a particular form of civil society is vital for social transformation, and why the world needs more civil-society influence on business, not the other way around  more cooperation instead of competition, more collective action instead of individualism, and a greater willingness to work together to change the fundamental structures that keep most people poor so that all of us can live more fulfilling lives....\n\nDoes Philanthropy Know Best?\n\nPhilanthropy can facilitate this \"particular form of civil society\" but it can never become it. I fear that as money has grown more influential in our monetarized societies, there has been a tendency for philanthropy to think it knows best. I have recently been challenged by leaders of NGOs working in migration, climate change, and human rights who have grown increasingly worried that foundations are stepping over some imaginary line and beginning to think that they are civil society. If those with wealth are using their power to act as if they are civil society  and are playing an increasingly influential role in the policy debate  where will it lead? In the long run it is likely to weaken civil society and the NGO sector, and eventually weaken our democracies. We are all aiming to be catalytic in our work, but engaging more as players without analyzing power relationships is unlikely to lead to fundamental change. It is more likely to lead to power being retained by an elite.\n\nIt is difficult for those who rely on philanthropy to be honest about their relationships with those that fund them. Shami Chakrabarti, the inspirational leader of the UK human rights organization Liberty, hints at what the power relationship feels like for those seeking funds from philanthropy. But it may be easier to hear the message from one of \"our own.\" Just listen to the words of Rien van Gendt in his acceptance speech for the Compass Award he was presented with at the 2013 European Foundation Centre conference, an award he richly deserved:\n\nFirst of all, through the eyes of the NGOs, the grantseeking organizations that I work with, I get a different perspective on what used to be my own world of endowed foundations, the grantmakers. The point I would like to emphasize here is that very often foundations have a very limited insight, to put it mildly, into who their clients are. We like to refer to ourselves as social investors  it gives us as endowed foundations a progressive touch  but the reality is that an average investor in a private market context would have more insights about his clients than foundations have. What do we really know about the problems, challenges, and expectations of our grantees? A lot of work is more supply push than demand pull. I am often struck, in representing the grantseeking organizations, by the arrogance of the foundation community....\n\nOperating or Grantmaking?\n\nOf course, within the broad spectrum of philanthropy, there are many different operating models. There have always been foundations set up to undertake their own work as operating foundations, and others that mix operational activities with grantmaking. Many have been extremely successful in achieving policy change through an operational approach and have built fine reputations for independent research and analysis. I am sometimes surprised that questions about the power and influence of such foundations are not raised more often. Issues of accountability are crucial, and the most successful have been rigorous in their research, using their convening power to engage sensitively with a broad range of stakeholders and to build consensus around agendas for change.\n\nWhat troubles me more is that there appears to be a trend among grantmaking foundations to move more in the direction of using their own power to determine what to do rather than building power within civil society organizations, which tend to be better rooted and to have a better idea of what's needed. Most foundations are more than grantmakers, but I would urge colleagues to be aware of the arrogance that van Gendt warns of and to promote \"power with\" rather than \"power over\" the organizations that need their resources to achieve the transformation that Michael Edwards describes.\n\nChanging Power Relationships\n\nThere are many good examples of a \"power with\" model succeeding. Some come from the world of community foundations, with their focus on bottom-up change. Jenny Hodgson rightly points out that community foundations do not always manage power relations well, but at their best they can balance and bridge the interests of different constituencies in a unique way. Albert Ruesga describes compellingly how the Greater New Orleans Foundation addresses the fact that the power of wealth lies so predominantly in one part of the community while the need for transformation is so glaringly obvious in a different part. Avila Kilmurray describes how the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland has taken big risks to ensure that former paramilitaries from both sides are fully engaged in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Whatever else philanthropy is capable of, it is well placed to support the challenging work of building power in communities that need a voice.\n\nDiego di Risio and Terry Odendahl describe how the Global Greengrants Fund has turned the concept of philanthropy on its head so that decisions on the allocation of resources have been handed from the Global North to those in the Global South who understand how money can best be used for transformation. The need for decision-making power to be firmly in the hands of local actors is also at the heart of Carolyn Hayman's description of Peace Direct.\n\nI am sure it is no coincidence that it is a women's fund that has pioneered one of the most remarkable examples of participative philanthropy. When Ana Criquillion first described to me how the Central American Women's Fund works, involving grantees in the decision-making process, I realized that this model had taken the notion of power sharing or power building to a different level. Ana describes how this model has been successfully adapted by the young feminist fund FRIDA on a global scale. And this example is one among many that Sophie Pritchard explored in her quest for a funding model that would break down the usual power dynamics for the new Edge Fund. All of these organizations' experimental work could well demonstrate new ways for different forms of philanthropy to develop.\n\nBut the issue of power is one that all foundations face, whether they articulate it or not. And progressive change is not the prerogative of those working from a bottom-up philosophy. In fact, it usually comes from a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches. As well as supporting civil society advocacy and empowerment through bottom-up philanthropy, foundations can use their convening power to build partnerships with both public and private agencies to influence more equitable policy and flows of public sector resources. This jibes with the special role that the King Baudouin Foundation plays, holding in balance, as it does, the many interests of Belgian society.\n\nDoes Any of This Matter?\n\nDoes any of this discussion on power matter? If we are in a second golden age of philanthropy, shouldn't we just celebrate the fact that philanthropy appears to be growing and having an increasing impact and enjoy it? Well, we certainly should celebrate the potential for change that increased philanthropy brings. But we would be ill advised not to pay attention to the downsides of the changing relationships that result in the growth of philanthropy. And the question of how philanthropy uses the power that increased resources bring is a central one.\n\nGeoff Mulgan is a friend of philanthropy and has benefited from it. He is also an influential writer on social and political issues. His message about 21st-century philanthropy rings true and is a good one to end with:\n\nThe key questions to be asked of any philanthropy are:\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it reinforce or reduce inequalities of power and wealth?\n\n\n\nWhen the hype and self-promotion is peeled back, what of substance remains?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some points in the past, societies have arrived at sceptical answers to these questions and turned against philanthropy, seeing it as a symptom of the problems not as a cure: as too unequal, paternalist, disempowering, and at odds with a world of rights. It's perfectly possible that similar conclusions will be reached once again with the current wave of philanthropy. The philanthropists assume that recipients will be grateful. Experience suggests this is wrong.\n\nIn the latest installment of our Alliance@PND series, Stephen Pittam, secretary of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, considers the shifting roles of philanthropy as it enjoys its \"second golden age,\" and its potential to support social change....",

Use the front end admin navigation (mininav) to see them.\n\nPromo items are child objects of promo folders and security will probably be in place to ensure this.\n\nUse the 'Promo One' and 'Promo Three' blocks as needed when slotting in promo items. These are very simple blocks that can hold 1 or 3 promoitems, respectively.\n\nTry to align the type of promo with where it will be displayed, for example a tall 'banner' image should go on the left or right zones, but not in the short top/bottom zones.\n\nPromo Item Scheduling\n\nLike any content slotted into a block, the promo items can be scheduled to display at a given date and time. There is an additional set of fields called 'publish date' and 'hide date' that are on the promo item to show/hide the promo item regardless of the block slotting. This is useful if a promo is used in several promo folders and promo zones through out the site.\n\nContent Re-use in Blocks\n\nLike any content in the website, you can re-use the promo items as needed throughout the site. Editors can pick any promo folder (or any content) when assigning blocks.",

        "title":"The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit",
        "content":"If you are an executive director, manager, or board member of an organization seeking to initiate a membership program The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit is an ideal, comprehensive resource. A savvy expert in the field, Ellis M. M. Robinson has more than twenty-five years of experience in the nonprofit sector and conducts workshops and training seminars nationwide on establishing and maintaining membership programs. In Toolkit, she generously shares her expertise with nonprofits seeking to diversify their revenue streams, and provides an easy-to-read manual for embarking on the process of either building a membership base from scratch or upgrading an existing membership program.\n\nThe book is nicely designed, and there are four main sections that make up the content of the volume. Part One, Integrating Membership into Your Organization, starts at the ground level as it focuses on the overall concept of membership as a partnership and the establishment of the necessary systems and protocols. The following section, Managing Your Membership Program, discusses building a renewal program, the value of sending special appeals, and also includes useful advice for creating effective publications. The third section formulates strategies that an organization can employ in order to expand its membership base by recruiting new members as well as converting in-house prospects. Robinson describes the advantages of both a direct mail campaign and electronic mail and online newsletters. The final chapters make up the last section on strategic planning for future growth, which covers regulatory issues and details a variety of membership plans.\n\nAlong with the wealth of useful information on creating or enhancing a membership program, perhaps the nicest feature of Toolkit is the integration of real-life case studies, worksheets, exercises, and sample publications throughout each of the four sections. The easily reproducible worksheets are practical tools that are designed to help users with tasks such as formulating goals, developing a campaign calendar, identifying mailing estimates and capturing in-house prospects. The availability of these worksheets via the Internet provides a convenient way for users to customize and file them electronically. In addition, the sample fundraising letters, newsletters and special mailings are effective in providing readers with tangible documents that can be adapted to meet the needs of their own organization.\n\nThroughout the last thirty or so pages of the book, the author has included a special \"Resources\" section that expands on several of the tips and suggestions described in the previous chapters. Included are listings of relevant books, Web sites and organizational contacts, as well as copywriting tips and the recommended protocols for handling incoming mail and data processing. The book's table of contents is tight and well structured, and there is an index in the back, which makes information easy to navigate within this rather thick volume.\n\nIn today's economic times, The Nonprofit Membership Toolkit is a welcome how-to guide for nonprofit leaders who wish to identify potential, dedicated partners within the community, while working towards the long-term financial success of their organization.\n\nFor additional citations to materials on this topic, refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject heading \"Membership drives.\"\n\nRobinson shares her expertise and provides an easy-to-read manual for nonprofits seeking to diversify their revenue streams by embarking on the process of either building a membership base from scratch or upgrading an existing membership program....",

        "title":"The Wrong Risks",
        "content":"During the early 1980s, I worked in a community center that looked after the welfare of an inner-city neighborhood in Mumbai. My clients were the poorest of the poor: pavement dwellers who lived on the sidewalks. We offered these families health services, enrolled their kids in school, and organized childcare for them.\n\nBut every fifteen days, public officials came and broke up their makeshift homes because it was illegal to squat on sidewalks. All we could do was give our clients a safe place to hide their belongings until the officials passed.\n\nBeing young and hot-blooded, a small group of us took the local government to court. At that time, India had a chief justice of the supreme court who regarded even a postcard from a poor person as a legitimate opening to a public interest suit. And so the suit commenced with relative ease. Our small group was very excited that we might actually change the policies that kept pavement dwellers impoverished.\n\nTo my surprise, however, my employer severely reprimanded me for this action and stripped away many of my discretionary powers. This organization, the Nagpada Neighborhood House, was one of the oldest and most prestigious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the city. Yet it was too frightened to take on the local government. Its reaction made us realize that a lot of long-lived organizations had become risk averse. They did not want to challenge injustice if doing so meant risking their own institutional survival.\n\nIn response, many of us resigned our jobs to start our own organizations. Observing that women quietly form the backbone of many poor communities, we decided to create local centers that help these women take collective leadership. We called these \"area resource centers.\" A visitor to our centers soon pointed out that we were not area resource centers, but a society that promotes them. And so we became the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC), an organization that partners with slum dwellers, the homeless, and other poor people to improve their living conditions and promote their rights while making sure that women remain at the center of this process.\n\nThat was in 1984. At the time, donors gave money to us because there was a sense of trust. These funders did not set our priorities; communities of poor people did. We might have seemed like crazy people, but we were making large strides and creating new tactics, so we were given all the space we needed. Consequently, SPARC and its partners now operate in nine states of India and help some 750,000 households.\n\nUnfortunately, the conditions that allowed SPARC to grow and succeed are changing. I cannot imagine donors in today's world granting an organization like SPARC the kind of latitude it required in its early years. Instead, foundations and large NGOs have become more focused on developing portfolios of projects, managing risks, and producing outcomes rather than on listening to communities, healing deep inequities, and supporting innovation. As a result, many grassroots organizations that are experts in solving local problems, but not very skilled at communicating with \"professionals,\" are having trouble getting funds. By paying so much attention to managing their own risks, philanthropists are no longer attending to the marginalized people who risk so much to make change happen.\n\nRisky Business\n\nIn SPARC's first five years, we did not know anything about housing, land tenure, or the issues with which we are today quite experienced. We did know, however, that poor women wanted to make sure that their grandchildren were not born on the pavement. So SPARC began exploring why some groups of people do not get land or housing in the city.\n\nWorking with these poor communities, we discovered that land allocation is a deeply political process that rarely serves the most vulnerable people. Indeed, the very poor usually remain invisible to their governments.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, SPARC undertook the first survey of pavement dwellers to find out their needs. We also helped create a toolkit that allows communities to conduct their own censuses, producing data with which to challenge the state's numbers. Then, over the course of many years, we slowly persuaded the municipality of Mumbai to implement a policy that helped relocate some 28,000 pavement-dwelling households to alternative forms of housing.\n\nAlong the way, we created a form of activism called precedent setting, in which we publicly break rules, encouraging the state to produce new norms and standards that will allow poor people to gain access to housing and citizenship. With these programs and tactics, SPARC negotiates with the very people who break up our homes: the police, governments, and private-sector institutions. Essential to this work is the simultaneous ability to produce informed dissent on the one hand, and to negotiate and collaborate with the state on the other. So we fight with the state and we negotiate with the state.\n\nOur achievements have drawn the attention of slum dweller organizations in more than twenty other countries in Asia and Africa. With these groups, we created a larger network called Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI) in 1996.\n\nEarlier in SPARC's history, we met the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF), a network of male community leaders who were defending their neighborhoods from eviction in eight Indian cities. NSDF did not like established NGOs because they were largely ignoring slum dwellers' needs. For instance, although the slum dwellers had no water, several NGOs wanted to work with them to improve their nutrition and hygiene.\n\nWhen the men of the NSDF saw what the women of SPARC were doing, they invited us to form an alliance with them. Along with Mahila Milan, which is a network of women's collectives, our alliance has created a safety net for poor people in a society with few social services. The three organizations have no official contract other than this agreement: If the day comes when we cannot work together, we will just let the alliance fall apart. To us, this symbiotic relationship strengthens our alliance.\n\nBut the informality of SPARC's alliances now horrifies everybody who gives us money. They ask, \"How can you take such a risk?\"\n\nOn the Margin\n\nIn the last ten years, the whole architecture of philanthropy has changed in ways that make it very difficult for organizations like SPARC to survive. The first change is what I call the \"log-frame virus\"  an infection that drives funders to insist upon seeing the logical framework or business plan of an intervention, from inputs, to outputs, to outcomes.\n\nI have to ask: Why this new obsession with logical frames and business plans? For many years, the World Bank has applied business practices to the housing problem in India  and failed miserably. Yet now, for far smaller amounts of money than the World Bank spends, grantees are expected to produce change through business planning. As a result of this mind-set, we now have to pretend that, in a period of two years, we can implement perfect strategies and produce complete solutions. Equitable solutions take trial, error, and time.\n\nThe new architecture of philanthropy is made weaker still by the professionalization of foundation staff. Donor organizations have such high rates of turnover that we, the grantees, become the keepers of their organizational history. Many of our program officers do not know what their organizations funded us to do ten or fifteen years ago. When the outcomes of grants given a decade ago finally emerge, none of the original staff are there to share in the victory. Meanwhile, more recent hires feel overwhelmed by their grant loads.\n\nMoreover, the new program officers are more likely to have advanced degrees. Seeing themselves as experts in our field, many of them feel that they can tell us what to do  even when they have only conceptual rather than practical expertise, or practical expertise for a different region. We dare not challenge them for fear of not getting our grant. We listen to their lectures in silence.\n\nWith their new strategies and new staff, foundations today are increasingly treating organizations like ours not as innovators, but as contractors who are hired to deliver their visions. We feel that our space  the development and evolution of community-driven strategies  is completely closing down.\n\nThese trends endanger SPARC and other organizations like it. Not only are we becoming the lone voice of grassroots activism in the global discussion of urban poverty, but the discussion of urban poverty itself is becoming marginalized.\n\nAt SPARC, we think of ourselves as a risk-embracing organization. We have always sought to share with poor communities the risks that they must take to change the status quo that keeps them impoverished. Now we would like more organizations to see that creating equitable solutions requires taking the risks that come with treating poor people as partners and participants, rather than as beneficiaries and consumers.\n\n(Note: This article is adapted from a speech that the author delivered at the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University on April 14, 2008.)\n\nMany grantmakers worry too much about managing risks....",

        "content":"Suzanne Morris, a successful investment banker working at Lehman Brothers in New York City, decided to make a significant life change by going to work for a small nonprofit that was poised for growth. She accepted a position as chief operating officer of an organization that helps female entrepreneurs grow their businesses through confidence-building tools and training, a mission that resonated strongly with Morris. She came to the job with a love of problem solving and a penchant for growing and managing teams as well as a deep admiration for the organization's celebrated CEO.\n\nDuring her first week on the job Morris learned that she was the organization's fourth COO in a year and a half. Morris was told that she would be responsible for human resources, legal, technology, and board management, as well as responsible for managing everyone except the controller, who reported to the CEO (and happened to be the CEO's sister). Morris felt that if she'd survived the rough-and-tumble world of investment banking, she could certainly tackle this challenge.\n\nOver the next nine months, however, Morris learned that the dynamic CEO whom she had admired resisted processes and systems, asserted tight control over all details, avoided delegation, felt threatened by opposing views, and contributed to a negative staff culture. It seemed that the CEO was not prepared for a strong management team or aware of the opportunity that having a strong team would present. Although Morris felt that she contributed to the organization's overall development, she decided that her skills could be better used elsewhere and left. By refusing to relinquish control, the CEO missed an opportunity to fully engage Morris and capitalize on her strengths.\n\nAwkward leadership transitions like this one are not uncommon, particularly when an organization is young and growing fast. When this type of transition is handled poorly, it can cause high employee turnover, low morale, inefficient systems, loss of credibility with stakeholders, and decreased impact. When the transition is handled well, it can help vault a small organization into the high-growth phase.\n\nInstead of resisting change, social entrepreneurs must embrace it at this critical inflection point by creating a leadership team of qualified and driven individuals. Ultimately, as a recent Bridgespan Group report put it, augmenting the experience and capabilities of the senior leadership team is often the most visible sign of change in organizations that are becoming more strongly managed. With strong management come strong systems, infrastructure, talent development, programming, and ultimately, meaningful impact.\n\nTo understand how social entrepreneurs can make the transition from running a start-up to creating an organization that is able to scale up, we interviewed dozens of social sector leaders. From these interviews we identified the steps that social entrepreneurs must take to build a team and the five leadership roles that an organization must have for it to be successful at this stage of its development: the evangelist, scaling partner, connector, program strategist, and realist. Before exploring these roles in detail, it is useful to look at one social entrepreneur's successful effort to create a leadership team.\n\nVision Spring's Experience\n\nIn 2001, Jordan Kassalow, a practicing optometrist, and business partner Scott Berrie formed the Scojo Foundation, a nonprofit organization that sells inexpensive eyeglasses to the poor, and Scojo New York, a for-profit optometry business. Five percent of Scojo New York's pre-tax profits are directed to fund the work of the foundation (which in 2008 changed its name to VisionSpring). Since its founding, VisionSpring has trained more than 5,200 entrepreneurs who have sold more than 360,000 pairs of glasses. VisionSpring believes that it can help reduce poverty in the developing world by selling affordable glasses to tailors, mechanics, artisans, and other professionals who need to see well to do their work.\n\nIn 2003, when the Scojo Foundation was just getting off the ground, Kassalow and his then senior director, Graham Macmillan, created a strategic plan that wasn't just about programs but was also about people. We tried to envision the organization five years down the road, says Kassalow. What management roles will we need at that point? They drew boxes for each role  twenty in total  and divided the roles between them. Kassalow's positions included CEO, director of development, director of business development, and country manager. Macmillan's roles included everything related to finance, sales, operations, and HR.\n\nThe two founders then began the process of shedding roles by asking which jobs we hated the most and were least good at doing, says Kassalow. Over time they chipped away at the boxes, erasing their names and putting in the name of a new employee with stronger skills in that particular field. The goal was to have Kassalow's name in only two places: the evangelist box and chief fundraiser box. When Macmillan decided to leave VisionSpring last fall, the board pushed Kassalow and Macmillan to define the skills Macmillan's replacement would need so that Kassalow could continue to shed additional roles. A job description for the position  now called COO instead of senior director  was created that highlighted deep financial, accounting, and people management experience, along with multi-sector experience and a certain gravitas. Government experience would be icing on the cake.\n\nKassalow filled the new position by hiring Sean Mayberry. Mayberry has senior executive experience at Population Services International, Intel Corp., and the U.S. Department of State. As Mayberry gets settled into his role as COO, Kassalow looks forward to replacing his name with Mayberry's in a few more boxes.\n\nBuilding the Team\n\nIt is rare for an entrepreneur to begin thinking about how to build a management team as early as Kassalow did. More often, entrepreneurs put off constructing a management team until they have no other choice. Kassalow provides a model for the steps that social entrepreneurs can and should take to create a strong leadership team that is capable of taking an organization to scale: recognize that you can no longer do it all alone, hold frank conversations with your board about the transition, and hire strategically rather than opportunistically.\n\nOne of the remarkable traits about social entrepreneurs is their ability to play many roles. They care deeply about how their vision is implemented and feel personally invested in the outcome. Social entrepreneurs are often so involved in all aspects of the organization that they end up holding up decision making, losing talent, and creating bottlenecks. At some point, grumblings of dissatisfaction from employees or frustrating inefficiencies emerge and need solutions. To avoid getting to this detrimental stage, the entrepreneur must recognize that he can no longer do everything himself and preemptively prepare to let go. Before hiring any high-level managers, he needs to assess his own strengths and weaknesses honestly. Social entrepreneurs must ask themselves questions such as, What do I enjoy doing? What am I really good at doing? What am I not good at doing? What kind of people do I need around me?\n\nBoard members play a particularly important role at this stage of the process. They should instigate conversations with the social entrepreneur about building strong, talented management teams, and preparing for leadership succession. To ensure that this happens, entrepreneurs should fill their board with opinionated members who bring skills, networks, and experience to the organization. Entrepreneurs must use the start-up stage as an opportunity to build trust with board members and ensure that board members are invested in the vision and long-term sustainability of the organization. This trust enables entrepreneurs to heed advice that can often feel personal or be difficult to hear. Strong boards help entrepreneurs grow comfortable with dissenting voices, challenged ideas, and evolving roles.\n\nEntrepreneurs should map out their senior management hires ahead of time. Too often, they see an oncoming cash flow crisis and hire someone with an accounting background, or decide they are overwhelmed with direct reports and hire a COO. Social entrepreneurs are often encouraged or forced to get a person or a skill set in immediately, says Sally Osberg, president and CEO of the Skoll Foundation. They often go into it feeling cornered. Kevin Flynn, director of client services at Commongood Careers, sees this behavior frequently. We hear, I need someone who is an entrepreneurial CFO and can do technology and fundraising and also code in Java,' says Flynn.\n\nThe Leadership Team\n\nOnce the social entrepreneur has spent time in honest self-reflection and frank board discussions, it's time to create a new leadership team. The entrepreneur must approach leadership team development with the same thoughtfulness and determination that he applies to creating his vision or he risks making the wrong hires. Our research indicates that there are five essential leadership roles in an organization that is ready to scale up. These roles may or may not be filled by five separate people; in some cases multiple roles can be filled by one person.\n\nEvangelist\n\nThe most important member of the leadership team is the evangelist  the person who is deeply passionate about the organization's mission and convinces others to help fulfill it. When the founder is still at the organization, he is the person who fills the role of the evangelist. If the founder has been replaced, it is the entrepreneur who is running the organization (often with the title of CEO, president, or executive director) who becomes the evangelist.\n\nThe evangelist has a number of responsibilities. First, he is the organization's visionary, continually refining its mission and strategy and making sure that priorities are established and met. He needs to share his vision with people inside and outside of the organization, especially with the leadership team. Willy Foote, president and founder of Root Capital, explains that the evangelist is going to see new opportunities that may not fit with the current organization's strategy, and his role is to get the team to believe in the value of disruption, while being very cautious to court disruption, not destruction.\n\nThe evangelist also maintains the organization's culture. For example, when Mike Feinberg, co-founder of the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP), served as CEO of the KIPP Foundation, he ensured that each conference room held the name of a children's book that held significance on the KIPP school campuses. All new hires learned the symbolism of these books and embraced the metaphors associated with them. For example, The Polar Express represented the message that all KIPPsters (students who attend a KIPP school) can hear the bells even when naysaying communities, peers, or adults try in vain to convince them that college is not an option. Each evangelist will choose a different way to keep the organization's culture alive, but he needs to be the person who constantly reminds others of the importance, characteristics, and values of the organization's culture.\n\nThe evangelist is also the external face of the organization. People want to understand the evangelist's underlying motivations for leading the organization and be captivated by the organization's founding story and long-term vision. The evangelist can skillfully weave together the organization's mission and programs with stories that express it in personal terms in order to truly evangelize and convert non-believers.\n\nScaling Partner\n\nThe second role that is required is the scaling partner. This person is the organization's pragmatist, someone who can think strategically and make the evangelist's vision a reality. Sometimes this position is called the COO, and other times the deputy or managing director. The scaling partner must enjoy creating and managing systems that improve organizational efficiency, as well as creating systems that allow staff members to enjoy their jobs and feel valued and rewarded.\n\nA lot of organizations are looking for entrepreneurial people who can build the plane while flying it, says James Weinberg, founder and CEO of Commongood Careers. But at [the scaling] stage, they actually do need someone to just build the plane. Or as Osberg says, the scaling partner is someone who can unleash the productivity of the organization by ensuring that people spend their time in the right way.\n\nErin Ganju, former COO and current CEO of Room to Read, is a good example of a scaling partner. In 2001, Ganju first offered to help founder and executive chairman John Wood manage his burgeoning organization. Wood recognized right away that Ganju was a good potential scaling partner because she could think big, yet was also detail oriented and enthusiastic about tasks that he didn't like doing. Before joining Room to Read, Ganju had worked as a product line manager at Unilever and as a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs. She immediately put her strong project management skills to use at Room to Read. She helped develop a strategy for entering new countries, formalized program design, and helped channel Wood's fundraising talents into specific programmatic areas. Ganju enjoyed managing operations, talent, and processes while Wood preferred public speaking, fundraising, and building a worldwide network of allies. Ganju was the perfect scaling partner for Wood.\n\nAs crucial as the scaling partner position is, it is also the most delicate and controversial of the five roles. At its worst, the position can become what Gretchen Anderson, former director of business development for On-Ramps, calls a dumping ground for the CEO. The role of the scaling partner works only when it is a yin-and-yang match with the founder, a true partnership stemming from trust and leadership. The scaling partner should be the first person the founder hires on the leadership team so that he can be a sounding board for all future hires.\n\nConnector\n\nThe role of the connector is to fill in the gaps left by the entrepreneur as he focuses on being the evangelist. Traditionally, this position might be called a vice president or director of development. It is also akin to the role that the chief of staff plays for a politician, maximizing the politician's time and ensuring access to important people. The connector makes sure that the evangelist is speaking to the right audiences at the right time and capitalizing on all opportunities. In addition, the connector ties development efforts to programs and manages existing funding relationships, freeing the evangelist to spend time on other activities.\n\nEven with these clearly defined responsibilities, the connector role can conflict with the evangelist, particularly in the area of fundraising, and cause tensions if the roles aren't clearly defined. Donors are the lifeblood of the organization, and having more than one person manage those relationships is risky. Even though it is difficult to divide these roles, it is important that it be done so that the organization can grow.\n\nJeff Berndt, a partner at New Profit Inc. who oversees investor relations, communications, and fundraising, is a good example of a connector. Berndt has four primary responsibilities. The first, which he describes as wearing out the soles of my shoes, is meeting regularly with a variety of constituents to build the New Profit network and deepen its long-term relationships. The second task is to make sure that Vanessa Kirsch, New Profit's president and founder, meets with the right people. Vanessa is gifted and has great instincts; our team has to Navy SEAL her in and out to maximize her impact. The third task is to make sure that the management team, and ultimately the entire staff, has the tools they need to sell the organization. The fourth and final task is to build the fundraising team, a complex operation that caters to the needs of the entire organization.\n\nProgram Strategist\n\nAll organizations  whether they are focused on education, health, or climate change  need a program strategist who is an expert in that particular field and whose role is to ensure that the programs achieve the desired outcomes. The program strategist not only has issue area expertise, but also understands how the programs are implemented in the field. This role brings credibility and expertise to the organization and its programs that may not have existed. The program strategist not only looks at how programs are running day-to-day, but also thinks about how the innovation can be scaled up, diversified, and perfected. Foote describes the program strategist as the sacred flame of the organization, responsible for creating a bridge between the reality of the programs and the vision of the evangelist. Without a program strategist with a strong voice on the leadership team, an organization can stray from its mission and end up scaling programs that do not produce the desired outcomes.\n\nAjuah Helton, the first chief program officer at BUILD, a four-year college preparation organization, is a good example of a program strategist. In 2007, BUILD evaluated a student's performance solely on his grade point average (GPA), dismissing students below a certain threshold. The policy was intended to honor the program's academic rigor and motivate students to perform better in school. The problem with this policy is that it often ended up dismissing the very students BUILD was designed to help, sometimes in their senior year of high school. As chief program officer, Helton analyzed data and collaborated with staff to create a new way of evaluating student performance. The result was the BUILD score. Instead of judging students solely on their GPA, the team also began evaluating students on other characteristics, such as commitment and passion, which served as strong indicators for longer-term success and better supported BUILD's theory of change. Without Helton's extensive experience in education, credibility with the team, and overview of trends, BUILD ran the risk of scaling efforts that would have reduced the organization's impact.\n\nRealist\n\nEvery organization needs someone on the leadership team who plays the role of the realist, the person who keeps the organization grounded in financial reality. This person is often called the chief financial officer (CFO). Placing the financial function on equal footing with other senior management roles ensures consistency, practicality, and coordination within the organization. The finance person is the bedrock position, says Jim Fruchterman, founder and CEO of Benetech. He or she inserts a culture of frugality and ethics, accountability for financial results, and reality. The realist is more than a financial officer, he is also the person rolling up his sleeves and minding the store.\n\nThe importance of having a strong and skilled realist is demonstrated by the traumatic series of events that a New York-based nonprofit recently underwent. The organization had twenty-six international offices, almost ninety staff members, and only two accountants. The board, evangelist, and scaling partner all understood the need for a realist, so they hired an executive from a leading New York law firm. The person had experience managing financial operations at a for-profit, but he was not a certified public accountant (CPA), had never run financial operations at a nonprofit, and had never directly managed accounting. For almost a year he claimed to be revamping the financial systems and yet very little changed in practice. Because of a host of internal oversights, the organization did not have the systems to distinguish unrestricted from restricted funds, double-dipped into reserves because of inadequate and decentralized expense management practices, and raised new grants without having adequate overhead to meet expenditures.\n\nIn February 2009, believing that the organization was $5 million in debt, the vice president of finance finally explained the financial crisis to the president of the organization (the evangelist). In short order, an interim CFO who had a CPA and strong accounting skills was hired. She personally audited the organization's books and traveled to every regional office to fix financial systems and expense practices and to institute cost-cutting measures. A recent external audit shows that the organization is about $2.5 million in debt. The organization will likely survive because of the strength of its programs and reputation, new leadership and systems, and committed and generous donors. Its long-term future will be decided by how the board and management team navigate the next six months. As this example shows, organizations with world-class programs, visionary founders, and strong partners can suffer dramatic setbacks without a talented realist.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nThe five roles above describe the skills needed in a successful leadership team. These roles may overlap, however, and may not always be held by a single person. For example, Julie McGuire, director of development at Spark, currently plays both the realist and connector roles. By owning cash flow and revenue projections for the organization, McGuire is able to connect development directly to the internal functions of the organization. Another example is Mayberry, who plays the realist and the scaling partner roles at VisionSpring, responsible for all internal operations, including managing talent, performance, financials, and operations.\n\nThere are other roles besides these five that may be needed in a leadership team as the organization grows. Marketing officers, chief technology officers, or chief people officers often appear in organizations that have passed the first major inflection point and are embarking on another scaling push. These roles are valuable, but can be combined with other positions or outsourced until the organization can afford to have unique positions created. The five principal roles, however, can't be outsourced or compromised when developing a leadership team for an organization poised for growth.\n\nAlthough our research and interviews focused on social entrepreneurs, many of our findings can also be applied to for-profit start-ups. Google's Eric Schmidt, for example, could be described as a scaling partner to founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, even though Schmidt's official title is CEO. Schmidt brought sound business practices to complement the creative and technical genius of the founders. The connector role at a nonprofit, to cite another example, is similar to the vice president of marketing and sales position at a for-profit. Both require someone with extensive networks and the ability to help strategically position the organization and its CEO. And it goes without saying that the realist plays a critical role in the for-profit sector where the bottom line is measured in dollars and cents and serves as the ultimate indicator of a company's success.\n\nWhen social entrepreneurs understand their strengths and priorities, and develop a leadership team composed of people with disparate and complementary skills, it creates what Wood calls the perfect combination. In a note of caution, however, Wood points out that if you only have a lot of corporate refugees who know strategy and process, they can scale like champions, but you won't have deep programs. Conversely, if you only have a lot of programmatic specialists with nonprofit backgrounds, your programs are incredible, but they don't scale. The solution, Wood continues, is to find your perfect combination and scale the heck out of it. When social entrepreneurs stop thinking of leadership positions as simply a solution to an immediate problem and begin to create roles and hire talent with the same vision and foresight that they use to perfect their idea and mission, scale becomes a natural progression rather than an elusive goal.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs are often reluctant to relinquish control and create strong leadership teams. Unless they make this important transition, the organizations entrepreneurs worked hard to create are unlikely to scale or have the desired impact....",

        "title":"Filling Out the Middle",
        "content":"Honey Care Africa, founded in 2000, was a classic early millennium story of social enterprise success. Its business plan  sell cost-subsidized beehives to farmers in Kenya, buy honey from them at fair-trade prices, and market the honey to upscale retailers  helped thousands of rural households. It gave farmers much-needed income and an alternative to practices that result in poaching and deforestation. The organization received an Equator Prize from the United Nations, plaudits from the World Bank, and funding from high-profile development agencies and foundations.\n\nThere was just one problem: Honey Care Africa couldn't make ends meet. And without nonprofit support, it couldn't stay in business. In 2010, the organization regrouped. It brought on a new CEO and enlisted the services of Open Capital Advisors, a financial intermediary based in Nairobi. Open Capital, part of a new generation of impact investors, helped Honey Care Africa revise its business model. Under its new plan, Honey Care reduced its reliance on farmers  most of whom didn't actually like working with bees  and hired local technicians to manage the hives. Farmers would still receive income for keeping hives on their property, but the new division of labor would enable yields and revenues to rise.\n\nNext, Honey Care needed to acquire working capital. Open Capital brought in the Grameen Foundation, the Lundin Foundation, and Root Capital, and created an investment structure that minimized risk for those investors while allowing Honey Care to grow. Two critical factors united Open Capital and its investment partners: a belief that market-based tools can promote social good  and membership in the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE).\n\nANDE, headquartered in Washington, D.C., has chapters in six regions: Brazil, Central America and Mexico, East Africa, India, South Africa, and West Africa. It's a hybrid entity that combines elements of a think tank with elements of a trade association. ANDE is not itself an impact investor. Rather, it helps people who work in that sector, and it puts particular emphasis on fostering the growth of small and growing businesses, or SGBs. In development circles, SGBs are known as \"the missing middle.\" They tend to be overlooked by grassroots microfinance organizations and corporate lenders alike, and as a result they have limited access to both financial and social capital.\n\nMany people in the development community believe that SGBs are critical to prosperity. They're arguably more efficient at alleviating poverty than very small or very large businesses, they create high-wage jobs, and they promote innovation. Nourishing the sector that finances SGBs is ANDE's core mandate. \"We're not about impact investing per se,\" says Randall Kempner, executive director of ANDE. \"Our vision is, we work with the full scope of players relevant to building a vibrant ecosystem in an emerging market.\"\n\nDefining a Sector\n\nANDE traces its roots to informal discussionswhich took place among people at several organizations  including Acumen, Root Capital, and the Grassroots Business Fund  that would become founding members of the network. For each of those organizations, SGBs represent one part of a broader portfolio; ANDE, by contrast, brings dedicated focus to that segment of the developing-world economy.\n\nThe network launched in 2009, with startup support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and six other prominent funding institutions. ANDE had thirty-two founding members. From that base, the network has swelled to encompass 170 member organizations that work in a total of150 countries. To date, according to ANDE's 2013 impact report, member-managed funds have directly invested $1.7 billion in SGBs. In addition, member organizations have spent $400 million on services such as training and research. Cumulatively, ANDE members have worked with about 60,000 SGBs.\n\nIt's an impressive trajectory. And although ANDE is able to leverage the reputation and the resources of its parent organization  the Aspen Institute, a high-profile think tank  its operations remain fairly lean. (It started with justtwo employees, and now has only eleven.) The network, in fact, owes much of its success to its core strategy: From the start, Kempner decided not to finance beneficiary companies directly.\n\nInstead, ANDE focuses on helping member organizations in nonfinancial ways. \"We're trying to support the intermediaries,\" says Kempner. \"I trust that they're going to have impact.\" Much of that support consists of bringing people together through conference calls, network conferences, and the like  simple but important activities that strengthen the social fabric of the SGB sector. Membership in ANDE, says Annie Roberts, a co-founder and partner at Open Capital, \"helps us connect with people we might not have met otherwise and gives us a lot of credibility in the market.\"\n\nEvents hosted by ANDE give leaders of SGBs a chance to expand their network. Fernando Assad, founder of Vivenda, a Brazil-based startup that helps poor families improve their homes, notes that ANDE facilitated an introduction to Ita, the country's second-largest bank. And an invitation to participate in an upcoming social housing event organized by ANDE's Brazil chapter, he says, is potentially even more valuable. It will give him a chance to meet government officials and leaders from a variety of companies in the housing industry.\n\nFor ANDE leaders, meanwhile, hosting events offers an opportunity to help shape what people are talking about. The network runs working groups on six issue areas  capacity development, legal affairs, metrics, policy, womens entrepreneurship, and youth entrepreneurship  and regularly holds discussions around each of them. In a similar initiative, ANDE has undertaken sector-mapping projects in Brazil, Central America, East Africa, and Mexico. By compiling descriptive lists of companies, foundations, and businesses in each region, the network provides SGBs and other players in this nascent field with a basic tool for finding each other. \"It's a very interesting time,\" says Rebeca Rocha, coordinator of ANDEs Brazil chapter. \"We are in a moment when the whole sector is defining itself.\"\n\nMaking a Big Tent Bigger\n\nIn the impact investing field, a debate has unfolded over the proper balance between creating social impact and pursuing financial gain. To put it another way: Should impact investors accept below-market returns as a cost of doing good? Is doing good the central purpose of impact investment, or is it merely a sideline to a standard investment strategy?\n\nANDE leaders have declined to take sides in that debate, preferring instead to create common ground where all parties can come together. It's a strategy that meets with approval among ANDE members. Steve Wright, vice president of poverty insights at the Grameen Bank, generally opposes the profit-maximizing, just-another-asset-class approach to impact investment. Yet he appreciates the chance to interact with investors who have different views. \"One of the tremendous values of ANDE is that JP Morgan, Citi, and others are in the tent,\" says Wright.\n\nTo Paul Basil, who leads another ANDE member organization, the conflict between social value and financial profit matters less than the friction between newcomers and veterans. \"The tension comes from a lack of knowledge,\" says Basil, founder of Villgro, an innovation incubator based in Chennai, India. \"The more you talk, the more lines of communication are open, the more you understand each other.\" He cites the value of ANDE-supported investor training programs, which help newly established investment managers adjust to common developing-world challenges  the lack of reliable market data, for example.\n\nAnother sector-wide conversation involves developing metrics. ANDE has put its weight behind the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards, or IRIS, a catalogue of measurements developed by the Global Impact Investing Network. As a condition of membership, ANDE now requires its members to collect IRIS data on five core metrics for each company that they fund: earned revenue, number of full-time employees, level of full-time wages, new investment capital, and greenhouse-gas emissions. IRIS contains hundreds of other metrics, but ANDE considers these five to be the most useful for gauging bottom-line performance.\n\nOfficials at ANDE are careful neither to overstate nor to understate the value of the IRIS approach. \"It's just a language,\" says Genevieve Edens, impact assessment manager for the network. \"It's not a reporting tool. It's a way to standardize what we're counting. By speaking the same language, we can start to compare one company to another, create benchmarks for performance, and create market intelligence. That's the power of a big network.\"\n\nThe use of IRIS is still evolving. But already those five core metrics have yielded enough data to help ANDE back up its assertions about the vital role played by SGBs. By the most recent count, 277 companies have reported on their performance via ANDE member organizations, and those companies are growing by an average of 10 percent annually. What's more, they pay their employees an average annual salary of $11,500  an amount that is much larger than the minimum wage (and often the median wage) in the countries where those companies operate. \"The most important challenge that ANDE helps to address is demonstrating the development and business case for SGBs,\" says Willy Foote, CEO of Root Capital.\n\nToday, the aim of ANDE leaders is to make that case to a broad audience of potential investors. During its first half-decade, the network concentrated on supporting its member organizations. Now it's time to grow beyond that base. \"As a first step, our goal was helping people understand the importance of helping SGBs,\" says Kempner. \"But it's one thing to build a sector, and another thing to drive more capital to it. Now we need to help others to believe.\"\n\nIn the latest article in our SSIR series, freelance journalist Brandon Keim explains how the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE)and others are helping the \"missing middle\" -- small and growing businessesin developing countries -- define and enhance their role inemerging markets....",

        "title":"Throwing in the Towel",
        "content":"You know that foundation that never returns your calls? The one you keep sending proposals to that never responds? You've poured over the foundation's 990-PF and its Foundation Directory Online profile. You've scoured the Web for information about its staff and giving. And everything you've found gives you reason to believe that if the good people at the foundation would just read your proposal, they'd want to invest in your organization. But you're still hanging on the telephone. Before you throw in the towel and decide to invest your time elsewhere, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Look at more than one 990-PF. One of the most important tools in the grantwriter's toolkit is the 990-PF the annual reporting form foundations are required to file with the IRS that provides information on their mission, programs, and grantmaking. And every good prospect researcher knows that it's essential to review more thanthe foundation's most recent 990-PF; the last two or three years should be your default, and four or five is even better. When reviewing 990-PFs, keep in mind the following: Does the foundation make a point of funding the same nonprofits? What are the exceptions? Does it make grants in the amount youre looking for? (If the amount of funding you are requesting is too much or too little the foundation is unlikely to fund your project.) While you're at it, be sure to review every page of the form. Sometimes there are additionalguidelines or notes tucked into the form that can be the difference between winning and losing a grant.\n\n2. Try to connect, butdon't overdo it. Every foundation is distinguished by its own communication style and willingness to connect.If thefoundation's policy is \"no phone calls,\"respect its wishes. On the other hand, if the foundation has published a phone number or email address, don't be afraid to use it. Just make sure you've done your homework and, should you reach a person in a decision-making role, that you're ready to ask and answer a few pertinent questions.\n\n3. Build a relationship.There are lots of wonderful books and online materials out there that show you how to cultivate a relationship with a funder. The most important rule, however, is the Golden Rule. Put yourself in the funders shoes and imagine how you would want to be treated if, for example, your local PTA calledat dinnertime to ask for your financial support. Be respectful and responsive, and remember that relationship building is more art than science and unfolds over time.\n\n4. Ask your colleagues for the scoop. In the fundraising world, having a network is critical. Leverage that network to find out what you can about others' experiences with the foundation in question. And be sure to reciprocate when its your networks turn to ask you a question.\n\n5. Know when to quit. In baseball, it's three strikes and you're out. Believe it or not, there are lots of foundations out there that simply will not fund a grant proposal from a nonprofit that is submitting their first grant proposal to the foundation. And there are more than a few that want to see a solid grant proposal from an organization three years in a row before they'll consider making a grant. But if after three tries youre still hoping for a \"hit,\" it's probably best to give it a rest untilsomething changes in your organization or program that better positionsyour proposalfor a favorable response.\n\nOne last piece of advice: Don't get discouraged. With access to information on more than 120,000 foundations through the Foundation Directory Online, you don't have to put all your eggs in one basket. Keep researching, keep digging, keep reaching out. If your program is a good one and you've done your homework, the investments will come.\n\nFreelance grantwriter Allison Shirk shares five things a grantseeker should do when a foundation doesn't respond to a grant proposal....",

        "title":"The Artful Juggler",
        "content":"Most foundation CEOs come into their role with no professional experience in philanthropy. According to research conducted in 2012 by the Center for Effective Philanthropy, 60 percent of CEOs from the one hundred largest foundations came from outside the foundation world. The Council on Foundations reports that 67 percent of all foundation leaders appointed between 2004 and 2008 did not come from grantmaking organizations. In some cases, newly installed CEOs had previous experience at nonprofits, but foundation boards generally seem to prefer hiring their chief executives from fields such as academia and business.\n\nThe practice of expecting new foundation leaders to learn their trade on the job is noteworthy, in part because the job is essential to the operation of a growing  and increasingly important  sector. In the past two decades, the number of foundations in the United States alone has more than tripled, rising from about 32,000 foundations in 1990 to approximately 115,000 today. The job of foundation CEO is also one that makes considerable demands on those who do it. \"As a leader in philanthropy, you want to take the long view and act with urgency. This is one of the key tensions to navigate,\" notes Thomas Beech, a retired CEO who led three very different institutions (the Minneapolis Foundation, the Burnett Foundation, and the Fetzer Institute) over a period of thirty-three years.\n\nI spoke with Beech as part of an extensive research project that I recently undertook. Although the world of philanthropy has begun to receive more media attention than previously, as well as more attention from scholars, little attention has been paid to the topic of foundation leadership. If we were to walk through the doors of the executive suite at a foundation office, what kinds of people would we meet? What are the qualities that enable a foundation CEO to succeed? I set out to answer those questions by learning from the experience of others. Along with reviewing the slim body of literature on the topic, I interviewed sixty-five people who have served on the front lines of philanthropy, including active and retired foundation CEOs, board members, and other leaders in the field.\n\nA Tough Act\n\nMy research led me to conclude that successful CEOs at foundations of all sizes tend to be artful jugglers  people who can pursue multiple high-pressure goals at once. They are able to tend to their board of directors, to manage their organization internally, and to drive their foundation to make an impact externally. By their own reckoning, few CEOs are equally successful in all three domains.\n\nEngaging the board. The CEO must ensure continuous alignment between the daily work of a foundation and the interests, passions, and values of its board members. As one CEO put it: \"Never get too far ahead of your board.\"\n\nWhen a CEO cannot achieve such alignment, unexpected challenges and failures occur: board behavior becomes idiosyncratic; unresolved interpersonal issues fester; board members end up being either disconnected from the work or over-involved in it. \"People who in their business life are very disciplined fall asleep in a nonprofit or foundation board role. They display no rigor,\" one CEO complains.\n\nConversely, when a CEO and board are closely aligned, the CEO is in a strong position to cultivate a sense of shared understanding. \"I spent a lot of time getting the board members comfortable with one another,\" recalls Chris DeVita, who served as CEO of the Wallace Foundation for twenty-five years. \"I gave them common experiences and created a climate of open inquiry. We created a terrific board team that is enormously helpful, unusually engaged, and committed.\"\n\nCultivating a healthy organization. The CEO is, ideally, the number-one culture leader in a foundation. Successful executives usually embrace the opportunity to build a healthy internal culture. Charles Edelsberg, CEO of the Jim Joseph Foundation, offers this advice: \"Obsess about the human architecture of the organization.\"\n\nIn some cases, CEOs view the responsibility of organizational management as a burden. One CEO tells this story: \"At one point, I was working with an executive coach who asked me what I was looking forward to next week, and what I was dreading. And I realized that everything I was looking forward to was outside of the organization, and everything I was dreading was inside  dealing with the board meetings, the organization, the hiring and firing.\"\n\nIn reflecting on her time as the founding CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Patty Stonesifer acknowledges that she could have paid more attention to the issue of organizational culture. She cites an axiom drawn from the hospitality industry: \"The front of the house has to match the back of the house.\" In other words, if you want to ensure that your customers will receive first-rate service, you have to treat your employees in a first-rate way. Foundation culture is the same. A foundation cannot have strong, trusting, productive grantee relationships if it doesn't have strong, trusting, productive staff relationships.\n\nAchieving impact. All the CEOs whom I interviewed are quite sophisticated about their approach to driving change in the world and were eager to share lessons on achieving impact. Here are two such lessons. First, learn from those with field experience. \"The real knowledge is in the community,\" says Beech. \"It is essential to develop relationships of trust and exchange with our grantee partners. The key lesson for me is that  contrary to the mythology of foundations  I can't control anything.\" Second, be humble in your work and be skeptical of silver-bullet solutions. \"Never presume that a great idea for solving a complex social problem is either original or sufficient,\" says Stonesifer. \"It likely isn't either.\"\n\nA Difficult Choice\n\nSelecting a new chief executive is no easy task, and foundation board members take it seriously. It's interesting, therefore, that in hiring their next \"artful juggler,\" so many boards choose a candidate for whom philanthropy is a new field. Boards, in fact, seem to have little confidence not just in internal candidates, but in any candidate with philanthropy experience. As rare as it is to hire from the inside, it is equally rare to hire laterally  from other foundations. (The Barr Foundation recently hired a new president, Jim Canales, who previously served for many years as president and CEO of the James Irvine Foundation. That decision is a notable, and perhaps promising, exception to the rule.)\n\nAlmost all the CEOs I interviewed, from both large and small foundations, emphasized how long it took them to understand their job, their organization, and the sector as a whole. It took time to learn about relevant fields of practice, to investigate donor intent, and to cultivate new donor relationships. It took more time to chart a grantmaking path, and still more time to build an effective organization. And finally, it took time to implement policies that would achieve actual change in the world.\n\nFoundation boards have a strong tendency to resist hiring from within. Board members focus on finding the best CEO \"in the marketplace.\"\n\nWhy isn't internal promotion more common? My research suggests that foundation boards have a strong tendency to resist hiring from within. Board members view hiring a CEO as one of their primary responsibilities, and they focus on finding the best CEO \"in the marketplace.\" The practice of hiring outsiders is reinforced by the executive search industry. Search firms have an obvious incentive to cast a wide net, nationally and internationally, when they generate names for boards to consider.\n\nSome attribute the rarity of internal succession to a lack of bench strength. They argue that most foundations have too small a pool of leadership talent from which to choose a new chief executive. But for several reasons, this argument is not entirely convincing. First, large foundations do have a sizable pool of experienced leaders. Second, many foundations have hired an executive (such as a chief strategy officer or a vice president) specifically to serve in a kind of number-two role; that person could be groomed for the top job. Third, foundations have more flexibility than almost any other kind of institution. If it were a priority for foundation boards to plan for internal succession, they could do so.\n\nIn his book Good to Great, Jim Collins explores how companies that he deems \"great\" handle succession, and he contrasts that approach with how other, less great companies tackle the challenge. Rather than pursue charismatic leaders from the outside, high-performing companies often promote their CEO from an internal role. Such leaders, Collins argues, can seamlessly build on the work of the CEO who preceded them.\n\nIn some cases, that principle clearly applies to foundations as well. Nancy Roob, president of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, was a program officer there and then moved up to COO before assuming her current role. She had worked side-by-side with her predecessor and the EMCF board as they reshaped the foundation around a strategy that focuses entirely on disadvantaged youth. Because Roob knew what the plan was when she stepped into the role of president, she was able to transform EMCF into an influential foundation that punches well above its weight. (A trend in this direction may be under way. The Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation both recently selected internal candidates to be their next president.)\n\nIn short, when foundation boards are looking to hire someone for the CEO job, they should consider people who understand philanthropy. Or, better yet, they should consider grooming that leader from within.\n\n(Illustration credit: David Pohl)\n\nIn the latest article in our SSIR series, Fay Twersky, director of the Effective Philanthropy Group at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and former director of impact planning and improvement at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, tries to pinpoint the qualities that make a great foundation CEO....",

        "title":"Outrun the Recession",
        "content":"Recessions are not sprints; they are endurance events. To find out how nonprofits are faring during the toughest recession in more than thirty years, we have been surveying a hundred nonprofit executives across the United States at six-month intervals since late 2008. As of October 2009, some 80 percent of our respondents had experienced funding cuts, and a full 93 percent said that they were feeling the effects of the downturn.\n\nYet many of our respondents are also adopting healthy habits that not only will help them survive the present recession but also may help them thrive when better times return. Below we summarize the seven healthy habits of nonprofits that endure.\n\nAct quickly, yet thoughtfully\n\nAnxiety tends to provoke one of two responses: unthinking activity or deer-in-the-headlights paralysis. Both are understandable; neither is helpful. Instead, nonprofits must be both thoughtful in their decision making and fleet-footed in their implementation. And that means planning for the worst, starting now.\n\nFor example, take the Women's Lunch Place, a Boston-based nonprofit that gives poor and homeless women and children a daytime refuge. By the fall of 2008, the organization had seen its funding reduced by $400,000 and wasn't sure what its future held.\n\nIn response, its executive team developed a contingency plan  that is, steps the organization would take if its funding continued to decrease. The plan focused on preserving the organization's flagship programs while steeply reducing its advocacy activities and general operating costs. When funding remained short in 2009 this contingency plan helped Women's Lunch Place continue to serve.\n\nProtect the core\n\nFinancial constraints often mean that nonprofits cannot pursue all of their usual activities. Rather than making across-the-board cuts, nonprofits should prioritize their core activities. They must then cut funding to less critical activities. To act on this advice board members and leaders must agree on the answers to two central questions: What work and beneficiaries define the essence of our organization? And what do these core services cost?\n\nThe Doe Fund in New York City is one organization that has made tradeoffs to protect its core. The fund provides employment, job training, and housing services to homeless and formerly incarcerated men. With funding shortfalls materializing in early 2009, the Doe Fund determined that its participants needed all of the services it offered, and at the level it was offering them. Rather than jeopardizing the integrity of its program, the organization made a tough decision: It closed two smaller locations and concentrated services in its larger facilities.\n\nFortify the best people\n\nIn good times, organizations need good people; in tough times, they need great people. Every organization has a small cadre  not just of staff members, but also of board members and volunteers  that propels its successes. If organizations must lay off employees, they should not first think about whom they can afford to let go. Instead, they should first consider which people are central to the long-term health of the organization. They should then dedicate the lion's share of the organization's attention and resources to these employees.\n\nOne organization that has managed to fortify its best people despite the recession is Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas nonprofit that provides services to people with intellectual disabilities. When revenue decreased, the nonprofit had to lay off staff. But to make sure that the organization retained its most valuable staff members, Opportunity Village's leaders performed two types of analysis. First, they identified positions to eliminate. Second, they identified the high performers the organization needed to keep. When a high-performing staff member occupied a position that was slated to be cut, Opportunity Village made sure to find her another role so as not to lose her skills and energy.\n\nDraw funders in\n\nThe donors who know an organization best are the ones most likely to stay with it through tough times. Nonprofits should reach out to their most steadfast supporters, rather than waiting for their donors to come to them or looking for new sources. Organizations should then level with their donors about their financial situations and their planned responses. By working with funders as partners, nonprofits may be able to change their funding  for instance, a donation's timing or purpose  to support threatened infrastructure. They may also ask donors to solicit support from friends and peers.\n\nThe Forum for Youth Investment successfully deployed this tactic for its Ready by 21 program. This national program helps state and local leaders prepare children and youth for college, work, and life. As the financial crisis accelerated in the fall of 2008, the forum and its partners decided to deepen their relationship with their largest funder. So the forum asked its funder to introduce Ready by 21 leaders to executives at other large corporations. This tactic strengthened the program's ties to its main donor while opening up new funding opportunities.\n\nShape up\n\nDuring these lean times, nonprofits should make low- or no-cost improvements to internal operations that make it easier for people to work smarter  and not just longer and harder. Clarifying roles and work processes will allow everyone to work more productively. Although a recession is decidedly not the time for growth-mode hiring, it may be the time to include people with different and broader skills  for example, adding a CFO who has more skills than a current controller who has to rely on contractors.\n\nWe at Bridgespan have seen how small changes in our operating procedures can have a big impact. With three offices, Bridgespan used monthly meetings to allocate resources. As we entered the increasingly uncertain world of 2009, we realized that monthly meetings were too infrequent to adjust to the rapid changes. By adding weekly half-hour calls between the three offices, we are better able to shift resources to meet the needs of clients and internal projects.\n\nBring in the board\n\nIn times of crisis, everyone is expected to step up to the plate. As the organization's trustees, nonprofit board members are very much a part of that \"everyone.\"\n\nBoard members can contribute expertise from other domains and sectors, test an organization's assumptions and plans, and help raise funds. They may also be able to complement staff efforts with focused operational support or to fill gaps if staff must be laid off. Greater Boston Legal Services can testify to just how important the advice of a board member can be.\n\nGreater Boston Legal Services offers free civil representation to low-income people and community-based organizations. When the organization faced potential revenue cuts of up to 20 percent, its executive director asked the board treasurer to examine the nonprofit's contingency plan and cash flow. As a certified public accountant and CFO of a real estate development firm, the treasurer had deep expertise in finance, and therefore he could adroitly analyze the organization's financial position. With this board member's assistance, Greater Boston Legal Services identified potential cash flow issues early and took the necessary steps  primarily increasing its line of credit  to make sure that the program could keep running smoothly.\n\nCommunicate openly and often\n\nLeading a team through tough times calls for open and frequent communication from the top. People need to know that their leaders have a handle on the problem, as well as a plan for how to weather or even fix the problem. They want to know where they stand and what the organization's prospects are. They also need to know when and how those prospects change, and what they themselves can do to help.\n\nIn addition, staff members more than ever appreciate small gestures from their leaders, such as frequent praise when they redouble efforts or tighten belts. Staff members may also welcome extra help on the front line from their leaders. They admire and trust not just strategic commitment, but operating commitment as well.\n\nOne organization whose leaders have kept the lines of communication open throughout the recession is BELL, a multicity nonprofit that offers afterschool and summer academic enrichment programs to youth.\n\nWhenever BELL'S CEO visits a city with a BELL site, she schedules town hall meetings with employees, taking their questions and explaining the actions that BELL is taking to stay strong. This openness and willingness to be transparent has helped BELL employees stay focused on their mission and avoid obsessing over rumors and unfounded perceptions.\n\nThe steps that organizations take to manage through tough times tend to endure. Making the wrong choices will have long-term consequences, but so will making the right ones. Constituents, staff, and funders will judge nonprofit leaders according to how well they run this recession marathon. These leaders' actions will make all the difference in whether  and in what shape  their organizations cross the starting line into the post-recession future.\n\nSSIR's ongoing survey of nonprofit executives across the United States has revealed the seven healthy habits that might help nonprofits not only endure this recession but also thrive when it ends....",

        "title":"Nonprofit Innovations (The C3SOP)",
        "content":"Large and growing nonprofit human services organizations routinely confront two formidable challenges to the effective execution of their expansion strategy: limited access to capital and high employee turnover. A recent innovation, the C3SOP, offers a means of addressing both issues.\n\nC3SOP is an adaptation of the employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\"), a type of qualified retirement plan sponsored by eleven thousand U.S. businesses. Adaptation of the ESOP concept to nonprofit organizations is somewhat counter-intuitive, since ESOPs are designed to invest primarily in employer securities (which nonprofits do not issue) and are encouraged by a series of incentives related to federal income and capital gains taxes (which nonprofits do not pay). Nonetheless, ESOPs are unique among qualified employee-benefit plans in their ability to borrow money, and as a result \"leveraged ESOPs\" have become a familiar technique of corporate finance. Leveraged ESOPs borrow to finance the purchase of employer securities; the loans are then repaid from the employer's ESOP plan contributions.\n\nWhile ESOPs have been associated exclusively with for-profit enterprises, it is increasingly common for large and growing nonprofit organizations to control both nonprofit affiliates and for-profit subsidiaries. In a C3SOP, a nonprofit parent company (\"Parent\") will acquire and hold the equity of its for-profit subsidiaries in a holding company (\"Holdings\") in which the Parent will be the controlling shareholder. Through the new C3SOP technique (patent pending), employees of both the for-profit subsidiaries and nonprofit affiliates will participate in an ESOP sponsored by the Parent, and the ESOP (via the ESOP Trust) will purchase a minority interest of up to 49 percent in Holdings. As a result, the Parent effectively will be able to acquire corporate control of a target company by purchasing 51 percent (rather than 100 percent) of the target acquisition's equity. In this manner, the C3SOP provides a new, substantial, and perpetual source of investment capital and can augment transaction financing otherwise available to the Parent, thereby enabling Parent and Holdings to grow more rapidly than would otherwise be possible.\n\nOf equal importance, the C3SOP can provide the Parent with a competitive advantage stemming from (1) the enhanced alignment of corporate and employee interests  and its demonstrated impact on employee turnover and service quality; and (2) tax benefits associated with shares sold to an ESOP.\n\nThe tax benefits enjoyed by shareholders selling to an ESOP can facilitate many acquisitions. To illustrate, an ESOP can provide a unique market for the equity of a retiring owner of a provider operating as a \"C\" corporation. Shareholders of \"C\" corporations incur no taxable gain on their sale of stock to an ESOP, provided that the ESOP owns at least 30 percent of the company immediately after the sale and that the sale's proceeds are reinvested by the shareholder in qualified \"rollover\" securities within a fifteen-month period. This could prove especially attractive to shareholders of closely held companies anticipating sharp increases in capital gains tax rates in 2011. As long as the seller continues to own the rollover securities, he or she does not have to pay capital gains taxes. If the rollover securities become part of the owner's estate, capital gains taxes are never paid.\n\nIt is common for selling shareholders to invest ESOP sale proceeds in extremely high-quality rollover securities that can be used as collateral for a loan. These securities are often floating-rate notes (FRNs) issued by blue-chip companies. FRNs are designed so that interest payments float in tandem with interest expenses incurred by the borrower using the FRNs as collateral. A seller will purchase FRNs with the proceeds of the sale of stock to an ESOP and borrow against the FRNs. The amount available to borrow varies, but is typically between 85 percent and 95 percent of the face value of the FRNs. The process effectively enables selling shareholders to utilize ESOP sale proceeds while avoiding capital gains taxes.\n\nESOPs can also play a key role in the acquisition of providers operated as S corporations. Effective with 1996 changes to the Internal Revenue Code, an ESOP can hold shares in an S corporation; these changes also provide ESOPs with exemption from the application of the unrelated business income tax on earnings from S corporation shares. Accordingly, neither the S corporation nor the ESOP Trust incurs any federal income tax liability with respect to S corporation shares owned by the ESOP Trust.\n\nIn the short term, many economists are forecasting continuing low U.S. interest rates, increases in both capital gains and income tax rates, and growing pressure on government to curtail budget deficits. In the intermediate term, there is a significant probability that the U.S. will face an interval of high inflation. In these circumstances, the timing is ideal for consolidation of the large and fragmented nonprofit human services industry. The C3SOP can play an important role in that process.\n\nThe president of Angler West Consultants explains how a traditionally for-profit model of employee stock ownership is a great tool for nonprofits wishing to increase their access to capital and improve staff retention....",

        "title":"The ABCs of Podcasting",
        "content":"On a summer evening in San Francisco, the Canvas Gallery, a caf next to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, is transformed into a venue for a multimedia presentation on the mysteries of gray whale migration along the Pacific coast. Amid chattering voices and clacking cappuccino saucers, organizer Juliana Gallin announces that local public radio station KQED and the Jean-Michel Cousteau Ocean Adventures Educational Outreach Campaign will record tonight's science talk for possible podcasting.\n\nAlready a near-ubiquitous feature on the Web sites of public radio stations, museums, and other education-oriented nonprofits, podcasts are an increasingly popular and inexpensive way of delivering audio programming over the Internet. Typically offered on a free subscription basis and delivered through software programs like iTunes, podcasts can be listened to on a computer, either online or offline, or transferred to a portable digital audio player such as an iPod or MP3 player and played back at your convenience.\n\nBack at the cafe, the curious audience listens to instructions on how to use a microphone to prevent speaker feedback. \"That sounds really bad in ear buds,\" says Stacy Bond, referring to the iconic white earpieces used by iPod users. Bond is the executive director of Audioluxe, a nonprofit partner of KQED's that produces podcasts and teaches organizations how to create engaging audio programming for the Web. Audioluxe trains beginning and advanced podcasters inside KQED's San Francisco studios. Costs for one and two-day crash courses range from $90 to $350.\n\nThat podcasts and podcasting are popular should come as no surprise. According to surveys taken by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 73 percent of adults in the United States, representing 147 million Americans 18 years of age and older, are online, compared to only 20 percent ten years ago. Factor in the ubiquity of iPods and MP3 players  the Pew group surveyed podcast listeners in 2005 and concluded that more than 22 million American adults own an iPod or MP3 player, while 29 percent of them have downloaded a podcast from the Web  and you have a phenomenon in the making.\n\nKQED, which broadcasts popular national public radio shows such as Forum and Perspectives to northern California audiences, is finding that podcasts are quite popular with its audiences. And by offering them on its Web site, the station is reaching new listeners  many of whom live hundreds or thousands of miles outside its regular broadcast \"footprint.\" For instance, when it launched the Perspectives podcast, which comes in \"bite-size\" two-minute episodes, earlier this year, Internet surfers found it immediately and downloads \"escalated like mad,\" says Colleen Wilson, the station's senior producer for interactive content. Web offerings like podcasts have \"definitely resonated with our members and people who were not members,\" adds Wilson.\n\nThe San Francisco-based California Academy of Sciences began its experiment with the technology in April by offering two podcasts, one to accompany a new museum exhibit and the other a thirteen-minute tour of the northern hemisphere's summer sky led by astronomer Bing Quock. The organization also has tested a service that allows visitors to use cell phones instead of iPods or MP3 players to listen to academy scientists talk about special exhibits like its African penguin colony. (The museum doesn't charge for the audio tours, but the cell phone minutes count against your plan.)\n\nLike the academy, the Monterey Bay Aquarium on California's central coast is constantly searching for ways to reach people through \"new channels of communication,\" says Ken Peterson, an aquarium spokesperson. \"We are experimenting with ways to reach folks, to further our mission, drive up attendance, and build more conservation awareness.\" After adding free podcasts to its Web site in May, visits to the site rose sharply. \"They're a great way of telling stories,\" says Peterson. \"And we hope they translate into more visitors being connected to oceans and ocean issues, but we're still trying to figure out how to measure the impact in a meaningful way.\"\n\nTrying to measure impact isn't the only challenge. The podcasting efforts of the San Francisco Bay Joint Venture, another environmental organization, got off to a strong start earlier this year after it partnered with Jerry Kay, who produces podcasts for the California Academy and Monterey Bay Aquarium, to create a series of stories designed to educate local communities about wetlands restoration projects in the Bay Area. Kay and his team recorded two ninety-second programs per week on topics ranging from \"Weeding Green Threads Into the Urban Fabric\" to \"Restoring the Lungs of San Francisco Bay.\" But after twenty episodes, the organization took a step back, in part because it discovered that even though each episode only cost $200 to produce, edit, and distribute, it was more difficult to recruit sponsors than it had anticipated. While the podcasts are on hold, the organization, with funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the James J. Gallagher Trust of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, recently launched another interactive Web project: on-demand audio and video tours of the Bay's northern wetlands. All audio features are available at www.yourwetlands.org.\n\nWhile you can always turn to media experts for help in producing polished, high-quality podcasts, a number of free technologies can help your organization create and distribute media content over the Internet. To pull it off, however, your nonprofit will need a certain amount of technological know-how and capacity.\n\nTo create your own podcast, you need a good computer, a fast Internet connection, and a quality microphone. For recording and editing programs, you can use Audacity, a free software program that works on the Windows, Macintosh, and Linux platforms. Macintosh users can also use Garage Band, which comes with Apple computers. Or you can forgo software altogether and simply record straight to the Net using a free online tool provided by Odeo, Inc.\n\nUnless you're lucky and word spreads like wildfire upon release of your podcasts, you'll also need to come up with creative ways to publicize them. Free tools such as feedburner.com can help. The bottom line is, if you have great content, there are always options.\n\nTo learn more about podcasts and other new Internet-based media tools, visit NetSquared, a project of Compumentor, one of the world's largest nonprofit technology assistance organizations. And if the cost of using the newest generation of Web media tools is beyond your current marketing or communications budget, don't hesitate to approach funders for support. Foundations increasingly are enthusiastic about projects that strengthen community knowledge and enable more voices to be heard. As Dan Reed, director of the Renaissance Computing Institute in North Carolina, reminds us: \"[T]echnology, in and of itself, is neither bad nor good; it is up to people to use technology to drive positive change.\"\n\nChristine Sculati, a San Francisco-based consultant who works with social justice and environmental nonprofits, gives real-life examples of nonprofits using podcasting  at low cost  to reach their audiences....",

        "title":"Calling the Piper's Tune",
        "content":"Nonprofit endorsements for sale? That might be the takeaway when more than thirty charities in the District of Columbia write to government regulators in support of a popularly opposed regulatory action sought by a local funder, with many even lending their logos to full-page newspaper ads.\n\nPepco, a regional electric utility that serves the District (and mid-Atlantic region) wants to sell itself to Exelon, a national energy company with a poor reputation among environmental groups and consumer advocates. The overwhelming majority of the charities endorsing the acquisition in letters to DC's Public Service Commission (DCPSC) have a couple of things in common: they have no environmental mission or apparent expertise on energy issues, and they have received or benefited from Pepco philanthropic funding, which Exelon promises to continue for ten years.\n\nThe offered premium of 24 percent over market valuation is enough to convince Pepco to seek approval to sell its electric distribution network to Exelon. The opportunity to become the largest utility company in the country and use Pepco's significant ratepayer base to dilute its nuclear electric generation investments is motivation enough for Exelon. But what's in it for local charities?\n\nA big part of the answer was summed up nicely by Meta Williams, the regional development director in the United Negro College Fund's Washington, D.C. Area Office. In a letter to D.C Public Service commissioner Brinda Westbrook-Sedgwick, Ms. Williams noted that Pepco and Exelon are important donors to UNCF, provide a great deal of support to other charities, and are admirable corporate citizens, making their plan worthy of endorsement. Yet, she went on to say in conversation with me that she had not considered environmental, energy, or related issues in deciding to write to the Public Service Commission, that policy was not made in her office, and that she was speaking only for UNCF's fundraising arm and not for the organization itself none of which is clear from her letter.\n\nAlthough the Washington Area Women's Foundation directly refused to discuss its letter in support of the acquisition, it likely made a mistake when, in addition to mentioning the importance of Pepco funding for it and other charities, it asserted that \"Exelon's reputation as a leader in environmental policy...augers well for citizens of the region.\" In fact, a number of environmental organizations, including Climate Action, Empower DC, the Energy Justice Network, the Environmental Network, Friends of the Earth, Food and Water Watch, Green Neighbors, Interfaith Power and Light, the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, the Nuclear Information & Resource Service, Solar United Neighborhoods, and the Sierra Club, all oppose the very deal WAWF wrote to support.\n\nSo, too, do several D.C. councilmembers, the attorney general of Maryland, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, and every one of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions that took a position (i.e., 19 of 41) on the issue. ANCs are composed of ordinary D.C. citizens elected by their neighbors to give D.C. residents more of a voice in policy decisions, and they are doing their job on this issue: 50 percent of D.C. voters have an opinion on the proposed acquisition, with 44 percent opposing it and only 6 percent supporting it. The Office of the People's Counsel also has made it clear that the proposed acquisition is not in the public interest.\n\nAnd yet, the American Red Cross of the National Capital Region, Homeless Children's Playtime Project, Latin American Youth Center, Salvation Army of the National Capital Area, Urban Alliance, YWCA of the National Capital Area, and others all have submitted letters to the Public Service Commission urging approval of the proposed acquisition and have declined or rebuffed requests to discuss what led them to take action on such a controversial issue seemingly unrelated to their core missions.\n\nTheir silence on this matter and their refusal to be accountable for their support of such a controversial plan is profoundly irritating. While the financial health of an organization may seem like the most important thing to its leaders, forsaking the broader common good for the narrow interests of any charity is something we should not condone.\n\nIndeed, having been rebuffed in my attempts to get the above organizations to comment on their decision to write the commission in support of Exelon/Pepco, I didn't even bother to reach out to Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind, Covenant House, Friends of the National Zoo, Greater Washington Urban League, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of the National Capital Area, or the many other organizations that wrote the commission to urge approval of the deal.\n\nThe tone, tenor, and structure of most of the letters in question betray another commonality among the organizations endorsing the Exelon/Pepco proposal. After reading the letters, it strains credulity to suggest that they were not solicited or that writing guidance was not provided by someone.\n\nPepco refused to make anyone available for an interview and asked that all my questions about charities' support for the acquisition be directed in writing to their media relations staff which then declined to answer, instead issuing a boilerplate public relations statement saying that the company had \"actively shared\" information with its \"nonprofit partners.\"\n\nA few of those partners did agree to chat sort of  on the record about the endorsement letters they sent to the commission. The head of Samaritan Inns, for example, said he was \"not in a position to comment on that\" when asked to discuss what brought him to pen an endorsement of the deal other than to say that \"our relationship with Pepco is a very valued one and I need to leave it at that.\"\n\nElsewhere, a staffer at Goodwill of Greater Washington regretted failed efforts to set up an interview with the organization's president/CEO and instead emailed his answer to a series of questions. In response to the question, \"Did Pepco or Exelon solicit a letter in support of the merger?\" the organization said that although Pepco had been a funder for a number of years, \"they neither required nor demanded that we write a letter in support of the merger.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nSimilarly, the director of the Anacostia Community Outreach Center said his organization did not receive \"direct funding\" from Pepco and was not asked to contact the DCPSC, and, moreover, that he often wrote unsolicited letters regarding important policy issues. When asked if he had been aware of the considerable opposition to the merger by environmental, energy, and consumer groups, he insisted that he endorsed Pepco's proposal regardless of whether environmentalists and others might have protested the corporations' plans because it \"is firmly rooted in a culture of philanthropy.\"\n\nBut does the support he's talking about really count as philanthropy? Decades ago, as corporations were beginning to put their independent foundations under the control of their marketing, communications, and public relations departments, people began to realize that the motivation for such moves had more to do with profit than the public good. In embracing that principle, Pepco and Exelon certainly are not alone.\n\nFor example, the New York Times reports that Comcast followed a similar approach in recruiting nonprofit organizations to support its proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable a now-abandoned deal that would have further limited consumer choice in much of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region and ultimately, according to experts, led to higher cable fees for millions of people.\n\nThe pattern of corporate funders using grantees to support their cause was raised to a high art by tobacco companies and today extends to major sports team foundations in California pushing for special charitable raffle legislation that would benefit their associated for-profit franchises. CEO Jan Masaoka said CalNonprofits is dismayed the leagues are contacting nonprofits that have received grants from team charities seeking to influence a public policy matter on an issue far afield from the nonprofits' missions.\n\nI'm willing to concede that Pepco executives may not have \"required or demanded\" that the company's grantees behave similarly in showing support for Exelon's acquisition bid. But when they and nonprofit leaders assiduously avoid discussion of the endorsement letter process, one can be excused for thinking that maybe the funder suggested to its grantees that their support would be most welcome and took steps to make it easier for them to communicate it.\n\nI sympathize with nonprofit leaders who work hard to sustain organizations that are doing vital work. I really do. In most cases, theirs is a thankless job. But we do the sector and society no favors when we choose to ignore heavy-handed tactics by corporate funders with their own agendas or give a pass to nonprofit leaders who promote a corporate funder's agenda at the expense of the public good.\n\nMark Rosenman is a professor emeritus at the Union Institute & University. In his last post, he explained how the charitable sector helps keep us all afloat.\n\nNonprofit endorsements for sale?

The report analyzed annual data from the March Current Population Survey for the years 1979 through 2006 and shows that while the current business cycle has seen an increase in the share of jobs that pay at least $17 an hour, this gain has been more than offset by a decrease in the share of jobs that offer employer-provided health insurance (down 3.1 percent points) and pension coverage (down 4.9 percentage points).",

As the 2015 target date approaches, many developing countries have already made extraordinary progress, improving the lives of millions of people. But not all countries or regions of the world are on track to meet the MDGs. Developing nations face many barriers to achieving the MDGs, some unique and country-specific, others broadly shared. Common problems faced by developing countries can be grouped into four areas: poor starting conditions; weak governance and institutions; conflict and instability; and environmental degradation. To meet the MDGs and create a sustainable path to development, countries must adopt policies and programs to overcome these problems. Developed countries have a role to play in overcoming these barriers as well. Aid donors, particularly the United States, must ensure that development assistance is flexible enough to help countries address these challenges and meet the MDGs.",

Klein argues that capitalism goes hand in hand with dictatorship and brutality and that dictators and other unscrupulous political figures take advantage of &quot;shocks&quot; -- catastrophes real or manufactured -- to consolidate their power and implement unpopular market reforms. Klein cites Chile under General Augusto Pinochet, Britain under Margaret Thatcher, China during the Tiananmen Square crisis, and the ongoing war in Iraq as examples of this process. Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level. Friedman's own words reveal him to be an advocate of peace, democracy, and individual rights. He argued that gradual economic reforms were often preferable to swift ones and that the public should be fully informed about them, the better to prepare themselves in advance. Further, Friedman condemned the Pinochet regime and opposed the war in Iraq. Klein's historical examples also fall apart under scrutiny. For example, Klein alleges that the Tiananmen Square crackdown was intended to crush opposition to pro-market reforms, when in fact it caused liberalization to stall for years. She also argues that Thatcher used the Falklands War as cover for her unpopular economic policies, when actually those economic policies and their results enjoyed strong public support. Klein's broader empirical claims fare no better. Surveys of political and economic freedom reveal that the less politically free regimes tend to resist market liberalization, while those states with greater political freedom tend to pursue economic freedom as well.",

The problem of housing New York City's most vulnerable individuals has given rise to a growing market of privately operated, for-profit residences known as Three-Quarter Houses. For all intents and purposes, these houses have become an informal extension of the City's apparatus for keeping vulnerable men and women off of the streets. Yet they lack any formal regulation or oversight, rendering the houses invisible to most citizens and policymakers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  The report's findings are based on 317 known addresses and first-hand accounts of 43 current or recent residents of the houses. The report paints a harrowing picture of the conditions in these dwellings. The residents tend to be in the midst of major life transitions; most are returning home from jail or prison, recovering from short-term hospital or residential substance abuse treatment, battling with street homelessness, and/or struggling with unemployment, family crises, or medical issues. The houses are over-crowded, lack basic fire safety and health provisions, and are exploitative of their residents. And thousands of New Yorkers rely on them, prefer them to shelters, and desperately do not want them closed. The findings of PRI's research on Three-Quarter Houses are troubling indications of what occurs when the city's poorest and most marginalized individuals are left with no affordable or accessible housing options and must instead fend for themselves in an unregulated, informal housing market.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  The research was carried out by the Prisoner Reentry Institute (PRI) of John Jay College, in collaboration with MFY Legal Services, Inc., Neighbors Together, the Legal Action Center, and the Three-Quarter House Tenant Organizing Project, with technical assistance from the Furman Center of Real Estate and Public Policy.",

That initiative calls for the hiring of some 700 lawyers who will be dedicated to prosecuting firearm offenses, such as the unlawful possession of a gun by a drug user or a convicted felon. The basic idea is to divert firearm offenses from state court, where they would ordinarily be prosecuted, to federal court, where tougher prison sentences will be meted out. Project Safe Neighborhoods will also provide funding to escalate gun prosecutions at the state level.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Praise for Project Safe Neighborhoods comes from quarters as diverse as Handgun Control, Inc. and the National Rifle Association. Unfortunately, those disparate parties have united in support of a singularly bad idea. Project Safe Neighborhoods is an affront to the constitutional principle of federalism. The initiative flouts the Tenth Amendment by relying on federal statutes that have no genuine constitutional basis. Moreover, the program will very likely lead to overenforcement of gun laws and open the door to prosecutorial mischief affecting the racial composition of juries. As the constitutional and policy implications of Project Safe Neighborhoods become more apparent, the Bush initiative looks less like a commonsense solution to crime and more like a political gimmick with pernicious unintended consequences. If the &quot;respect for federalism&quot; he has repeatedly professed is sincere, President Bush must reconsider his support for Project Safe Neighborhoods.",

Furthermore researchers have been unable to determine whether or not one's VSL is stableacross multiple decision environments using revealed preference methods. Understanding thesetradeoffs (and the VSL that they imply) may be used to inform resource management policy andsafety regulations, as well as our general understanding of the value of life. By modeling a commercial fishing captain's choice to fish or not, conditional on the observed risk, this research investigates these topics using data from the Alaskan red king crab and snow crab fisheries. Using weather conditions and policy variables as instruments, our estimates of the mean VSL range from $4.00M to $4.76M (depending on the modeling assumption and fishery analyzed) and are robust to the incorporation of heterogeneous preferences. Furthermore, given the unique nature of the data we are able to conduct an intra-vessel comparison of the VSL and conclude that for roughly 92% of thefishermen observed in the data set their VSL estimates are stable across both fisheries.",

In 2003, it accounted for 7 percent of US electricity generated from renewable sources. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - The United States is the world's largest producer of geothermal energy. About 2,800 megawatts (MW) of geothermal electrical capacity is connected to the electrical grid in the United States; 8,000 MW of geothermal electrical capacity is installed worldwide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - The US Geological Survey (USGS) has identified approximately 22,000 MW of geothermal resources sufficient for electrical power generation in the United States. In addition, low-temperature resources sufficient for direct-use and heat pumps are available across the country. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - The largest geothermal development in the world is at The Geysers in California. This plant, in operation since 1960, has a capacity of over 850 MW and satisfies nearly 70 percent of the average electrical demand for the Californian North Coast region. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  - Electricity from The Geysers sells for $0.03 to $0.035 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while electricity from newer geothermal plants costs between $0.05 and $0.08 per kWh.

        "content":"Human services cover a broad range of programs, services, and facilities provided to the public that are designed to enhance the quality of life and well-being of people and communities. In most cases, human services are provided by agencies at the community level and include programs and services such as affordable housing, child care, mental health and substance use treatment, and job training, as well as those targeting specific populations such as immigrants, seniors, or people experiencing homelessness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This paper outlines an approach to estimating the size of the human service workforce in Illinois. Quantifying the size of Illinois' human service workforce fills a knowledge gap; with such diversity among human service organizations, a total figure for the entire sector has not before been estimated. An estimate of workers employed in human service organizations gives a sense of how much of the workforce is dependent on human service jobs. Additionally, it gives context and illustrates the relative size of this portion of the workforce to examine cross state comparisons in terms of the number of human service workers to residents in each state.",

        "content":"Regional growth-management planning makes housing unaffordable and contributes to a business-unfriendly environment that slows economic growth. The high housing prices caused by growth-management planning were an essential element of the housing bubble that has recently shaken our economy: for the most part, this bubble was limited to urban regions with growth-management planning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In 2006, the price of a median home in the 10 states that have passed laws requiring local governments to do growth-management planning was five times the median family income in those states. At that price, a median family devoting 31 percent of its income (the maximum allowed for FHA-insured loans) to a mortgage at 6 percent, with a 10 percent down payment, could not pay off the mortgage on a median home in less than 59 years. In contrast, a median home in the 22 states that have no growth-management laws or institutions cost only 2.7 times the median family income. This meant a family could pay off a home in just 12.5 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Growth-management tools such as urban-growth boundaries, adequate-public-facilities ordinances, and growth limits all drive up the cost of housing by artificially restricting the amount of land available or the number of permits granted for home construction. On average, homebuyers in 2006 had to pay $130,000 more for every home sold in states with mandatory growth-management planning than they would have had to pay if home price-to-income ratios were less than 3. This is, in effect, a planning tax that increases the costs of retail, commercial, and industrial developments as well as housing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  The key to keeping housing affordable is the presence of large amounts of relatively unregulated vacant land that can be developed for housing and other purposes. The availability of such low-cost land encourages cities to keep housing affordable within their boundaries. But when state or other planning institutions allow cities to gain control over the rate of development of rural areas, they lose this incentive, and housing quickly becomes unaffordable. States with growth-management laws should repeal them, and other states should avoid passing them.",

        "content":"In 2012, women working full time in the United States typically were paid just 77 percent of what men were paid, a gap of 23 percent. The gap has narrowed since the 1970s, due largely to women's progress in education and workforce participation and to men's wages rising at a slower rate. Progress has stalled in recent years, and the pay gap does not appear likely to go away on its own.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Equal pay is not simply a women's issue -- it's a family issue. Families increasingly rely on women's wages to make ends meet. In typical married households, women's incomes accounted for 36 percent of total family income in 2008, up from 29 percent in 1983. A large majority of mothers are in the paid labor force, and about one-third of employed mothers are the sole breadwinners for their families.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  For the 34 percent of working mothers who are their families' sole breadwinner -- either because they are single parents or their spouses are not in the labor force -- the gender pay gap can contribute to poor living conditions,poor nutrition, and fewer opportunities for their children. For these women, closing the gender pay gap is much more than a point of pride -- it'sa matter of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This guide provides key facts about the gender pay gap in the United States, along with explanations and resources.",

From its early days as a vague theoretical concept, which was often viewed as a threat to advocating for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it has developed into a widely, albeit not universally, recognized governmental mandate to reduce societal vulnerability to climate change. While it is important to appreciate the progress that we are making on this issue, it is impossible to ignore the urgent need to do more. Smart investment can be made by reflecting on what is already underway in order to determine where to build on existing efforts and where to innovate new approaches to fill the gaps in the path forward. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  In this report we provide illustrative examples of the variety of work on climate change adaptation that is underway in the United States. This is by no means an exhaustive survey of the field; however it does provide insight into the dominant focus of work to date, the resultant gaps, and the opportunities available for advancing this essential aspect of sustainability. We focus on four areas of activity -- agriculture, natural resources, human communities, and policy. The general trends relevant to these sectors can be applied more broadly to other sectors and countries. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Adaptation can be thought of as a cycle of activities that ultimately -- if successful -- reduces vulnerability to climate change. This process starts with identifying the impacts of climate change to determine the types of problems climate change might pose. This includes all of the research on the causes and the global, regional, and local manifestations of climate change, often referred to as impacts assessments.",

There are many reasons for the field's rapid growth, including extraordinary leadership by those who have headed the movement. But the support of numerous foundations and other donors has played a vital part in fueling the field's expansion. Contributions have come from all parts of the philanthropic community. Smaller foundations, for example, have played a significant role in strengthening the capacity of regional and local immigrant-serving organizations that are backbone of the movement.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To help tell the story of philanthropy's contribution to the development of an immigrant rights field in United States, the Ford Foundation commissioned journalist Louis Freedberg, with assistance from Ted Wang, to write this report. It describes how Ford initially entered the field, the challenges the Foundation and its grantees faced in the early years, how funders have worked together to support an emerging but vibrant movement, and the lessons learned to help inform future efforts to support the field. The authors' observations are their own and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Ford Foundation. They point out that the power of philanthropic grantmaking in this area has come from a combination of factors: committed long-term funders who have supported this field for many years; a willingness to fund a wide range of organizations that provide complementary activities; flexibility to adjust grantmaking to changing conditions; and an openness among funders to collaborate with each other and as well as with grantees to achieve a shared vision.",

The Sunken Billions study shows that the difference between the potential and actual net economic benefits from marine fisheries is in the order of $50 billion per year  equivalent to more than half the value of the global seafood trade. The cumulative economic loss to the global economy over the last three decades is estimated to be in the order of two trillion dollars. In many countries the catching operations are buoyed up by subsidies, so that the global fishery economy to the point of landing (the harvest sub-sector), is in deficit. Improved governance can recapture a substantial proportion of the of this $50 billion annual economic loss. With effective economic incentives, rather than being a net drain on the global economy, sustainable fisheries can create an economic surplus, be a driver of economic growth and a basis for livelihood opportunities. Economically, healthy fisheries are fundamental to achieving not only the restoration of fish stocks but other accepted objectives for the fisheries sector, such as improved livelihoods, exports, fish food security and economic growth. When fish stocks are fully exploited in the biological sense, the associated fisheries are almost invariably performing below their economic optimum. In some cases, fisheries may be biologically sustainable but still operate at an economic loss. The depletion in fish capital resulting from overexploitation is rarely reflected in the reckoning of a nation's overall capital and GDP growth. For over three decades the world's marine fish stocks have come under increasing pressure from fishing, from loss of habitats and from pollution. Rising sea temperatures and the increasing acidity of the oceans is placing further stress on already stressed ecosystems. Illegal fishing and unreported catches undermine fishery science while some subsidies continue to support unsustainable fishing practices. Marine fisheries reform can recapture a substantial proportion of the economic losses. Rather than being a net drain on the global economy, sustainable fisheries can create an economic surplus and be a driver of economic growth, both in the marine economy and other sectors. The biological sustainability of fish stocks has often occupied the centre stage of international efforts, for example, the Plan of Implementation of the WSSD makes specific reference to recovery of fish stocks. However sustainable fisheries are not only a problem of biology and ecology, but one of managing political and economic processes and replacing pernicious incentives with those which foster improved governance and responsible stewardship. The comprehensive reforms required imply political, social and economic costs. Fisheries reform is a long-term process and will require political will founded on a consensus vision built through broad stakeholder dialogue.",

        "content":"Social Security has made it possible for the vast majority of workers to enjoy a period of retirement in at least modest comfort without relying on their children for support. The average length of retirement has increased consistently since the program was started in 1937. However, the increase in the normal retirement age from 65 to 67 that is being phased in over the years 2003 to 2022 largely offsets the increase in life expectancy. As a result, workers who work long enough to collect their full benefits will see little gain in the expected length of their retirement over this period.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  These gains have gone overwhelmingly to workers in the top half of the income distribution. Consequently, the increase in retirement age will offset the gains in retirement lengths for the bottom half -- even if there is no further inequality in improvements in life expectancy. If such inequality in improvements persist, then the bottom half of workers born in 1973 will have retirements no longer than those born in 1937.",

The first scenario assumes that real house prices fall no further than their level as of March 2008. The second scenario assumes that real house prices fall an additional 10 percent as a 2009 average. The third scenario assumes that real house prices fall an additional 20 percent for a 2009 average. The projections show that the vast majority of families will see a substantial reduction in wealth by 2009 in any of these scenarios and that the cohorts just approaching retirement will have very little to support themselves in retirement other than their Social Security. The projections also show that a large number of families will have little or no equity in their homes in 2009.",

We should not allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by the degree and complexity of the challenges. Nor should we be seduced by the hype often associated with the opportunities. As with other grand transformations that have shaken our nation, the transformation from an industrial to information age will test our character, unity and national will.&lt;br /&gt;  A fundamental change is occurring in how human beings organize work and economic activity, driven only in part by developments in information technology (IT). Information, knowledge and other &quot;intangibles&quot; dominate business and commerce, both as inputs to the production process and as end products in and of themselves. In this new era, social capital and intellectual capital play roles as important as financial capital in commerce and society. With this in mind, Athena Alliance hosted a conference (&quot;New IT -- New Equity -- New Economy&quot;) to explore the issues involving those left behind in the new information age. The discussion at that conference -- and subsequent events -- leads5 to a straightforward conclusion: it is time to broaden the debate. We must move from &quot;divide&quot; to &quot;inclusion&quot; as the central organizing principle of our analysis and actions. In other words, we must move the debate from access to the Internet -- the original definition of the digital divide -- to inclusion in the information economy. The issue is not simply the utilization of IT. Our task is to develop a more encompassing description of the technological, economic and social aspects of the revolution in IT and the rise of a new economy.",

        "content":"One of the most important goals of government policy is to address inequalities in the distribution of income and to try to improve the welfare of the poor. An important part of the theory and practice of public finance is dedicated to conceptualizing and measuring how the revenue and expenditure sides of government budgets affect the distribution of income among households. This is known as tax and expenditure incidence, or in short, fiscal incidence. This body of research allows us to understand how government policies change the distribution of income, how equitable these changes may be, and, in particular, how government policies actually help the poor.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Establishing the incidence of taxes is important because who actually bears the burden of taxes is generally quite different from those legally liable to make payment to the tax authorities. Establishing the incidence of government expenditures is important because not all expenditures benefit households of different income levels to the same extent. Even those government expenditures intended to benefit low income households may not do so because poor targeting or difficulties exist for the poor to have access to the public services. In short, the impact of government budgets on the distribution of income and the status of the poor is not immediate and general impressions regarding what the impact may be can be quite mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Incidence analysis is not only important but also, if done correctly, complex and difficult. Incidence analysis contains a blend of positive and normative issues. Asking the question of who benefits from and who pays for government services is eminently a positive question. However, judging the adequacy, desirability or rightness of these results is a normative question. Normative values are likely to differ, sometimes quite significantly across individuals, so we should not expect to always find consensus on the desirable degree of redistribution. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to shy away from distributional and equity issues because they cannot be scientific. The distributional impact of government policy is in the core of what policy makers and ordinary citizens expect economists to do.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Ultimately, tax and benefit incidence analysis is an effective tool to review whether government tax policies and expenditure programs have the desired impact on income distribution and on the poor. Major tax reforms and large government expenditure programs are routinely undertaken in many countries with specific redistributional objectives, including lifting tax burdens borne by lower income groups and directly helping the poor. For example, understanding the incidence of expenditures on education and health vis-a-vis the poor is important because improved health and education status have been shown to be the most effective means of escaping poverty. Tax policy and public expenditures, especially the latter, are potentially powerful tools to combat poverty. Thus, an important question is whether government tax and expenditure policies have the intended effects. This is what benefit incidence analysis does.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Working Paper Number 01-10.",

Although many tax evasion studies have been motivated by the horizontal and vertical inequalities generated by tax evasion, the potential distributional impact of tax evasion has not been closely examined in the literature. In traditional models, the incidence of evasion has not been closely examined in the literature. In traditional models, the incidence of evasion is simple: the tax evader alone benefits from evasion and therefore there is no need to examine the issue further. However, potentially successful tax evasion can be considered as similar to tax advantages provided in the law. From that perspective, it is clear that the incidence of tax evasion can be as complex as the incidence of taxation. A critical difference between the theory of tax incidence and the theory of tax evasion incidence is the element of uncertainty almost always present in the latter. This paper explores allocational and distributional issues in the incidence of evasion, the main features that models of evasion incidence must have, and the implications of evasions incidence for tax policy and tax administration.",

These programs may have succeeded in identifying a social need, a cogent and sometimes creative way of meeting that need, and some capacity (both financial and operational) to launch the effort.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; These are necessary elements -- but not sufficient ones. The social policy field does not consistently recognize or reward good ideas. Success is often as much a product of unusual circumstances -- confluence of the right time, the right idea and the right people -- as it is a result of inherent program quality and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Amachi program is a prime illustration of the unpredictable nature of success in the social policy arena. Its success resulted from a nearly unique blend of factors -- Public/Private Ventures (P/PV), which had been studying the issue of relationships as a way of helping young people for almost two decades; the Pew Charitable Trusts' interest in the potential of faith-based organizations to meet social needs; the well-known academic John DiIulio, who was looking for practical ways to put Pew's interest into action; a source of stabilizing program knowledge (Big Brothers Big Sisters of America); and finally a leader, W. Wilson Goode, Sr., whose combination of personal contacts, managerial knowledge and experience, and dedication to the idea of Amachi was decisive in making the program a success locally, and later nationally.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Politics also played a role: the election of a president (in 2000) interested in faith-based initiatives; DiIulio's role in steering the president's attention to Amachi during its early days in Philadelphia; and the way that attention led to a sustained national focus (with federal program funding) on the target group Amachi was designed to serve: children of prisoners. The interplay of these factors -- along with good luck and good timing -- is in many ways the core of the Amachi story, which is detailed in the pages that follow.",

        "content":"The recent shootings at a Montreal school have reignited the controversy over the firearm registry and has prompted the current Conservative government to review its earlier pledge to scrap the registry. This paper is a timely effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the 1995 firearm legislation that created the firearm registry. In 1995, the government assumed that, by controlling the availability of firearms, the registry would reduce total criminal violence, not just gun violence, suicide and domestic abuse. I argue here that this legislation is fundamentally flawed because it relies upon public health research to justify its moralistic approach to firearms. Public health advocates have exaggerated the danger of firearm ownership through pseudoscientific research methods. The federal government's moralistic approach to public safety is compared with a more practical and consultative provincial program that is more successful. The firearm registry involves licensing firearm owners as well as registering firearms. Even though the registry was created by the 1995 legislation, it was not implemented until 1998. Since that time there has been a significant reduction in the number of firearm owners, the number of crimes involving firearms, and the number of firearms-related deaths. Nevertheless, public safety cannot be said to have improved, because total criminal violence and total suicide rates remain stubbornly stable, despite the drop in firearms-related violence. Since the registry, with its dual function of licensing owners and registering longarms, was first implemented in 1998, the total homicide rate has actually increased by 9%, while the overall violent crime rate declined by 4%. Perhaps the most striking change is that gang-related homicides have increased substantially -- almost doubling between 1998 and 2005. Despite the drop in firearm-related suicides, the overall suicide rate declined by just 3% since the registry began. Unfortunately, an increase in suicides involving hanging has nearly cancelled out the drop in firearm suicides. No persuasive link has been found between the firearm registry and any of these changes. Provincial hunter-safety programs, in contrast, are more consultative, and available evidence suggests that such programs have been effective.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, no convincing empirical evidence can be found that the firearm program has improved public safety. Violent crime and suicide rates remain virtually unchanged despite the nearly unlimited annual budgets during the first seven years of the firearms registry. Notwithstanding an estimated $2 billion cost to date, the firearms registry remains notably incomplete and has an error rate that remains embarrassingly high. As a result of its many failures, particularly its failure to reduce gang violence or stop senseless killings like at Dawson College and Mayerthorpe, the firearms registry has failed to win the trust of either the public or the police.",

        "content":"Some policymakers in the United States and Europe argue that it is possible to enjoy economic growth and also have a large welfare state. These advocates for bigger government claim that the socalled Nordic Model offers the best of both worlds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This claim does not withstand scrutiny. Economic performance in Nordic nations is lagging, and excessive government is the most likely explanation. The public sector in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland consumes, on average, more than 48 percent of economic output. Total government outlays in the United States, by contrast, are less than 37 percent of gross domestic product. Revenue comparisons are even more striking. Tax receipts average more than 45 percent of GDP in Nordic nations, a full 20 percentage points higher than the aggregate tax burden in the United States. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  This bigger burden of government hurts Nordic competitiveness, both because government spending consumes resources that could be more efficiently allocated by market forces and because the accompanying high tax rates discourage productive behavior. A smaller state sector is one reason why the United States is more prosperous. Per capita GDP in the United States is more than 15 percent higher than it is in the Nordic nations. The gap is even larger when comparing disposable income, private consumption, and other measures that reflect living standards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Notwithstanding problems associated with a large welfare state, there is much to applaud in Nordic nations. They have open markets, low levels of regulation, strong property rights, stable currencies, and many other policies associated with growth and prosperity. Indeed, Nordic nations generally rank among the world's most market-oriented nations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nordic nations also have implemented some pro-market reforms. Every Nordic nation has a lower corporate tax rate than the United States, for example, and most of them have low-rate flat tax systems for capital income. Iceland even has a flat tax for labor income. And both Iceland and Sweden have partially privatized their social security retirement systems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Nordic nations offer valuable lessons for policymakers, but they do not fit the traditional stereotype. Conservative critics correctly condemn the large welfare states, but often overlook the positive results generated by laissez-faire policies in other areas. Liberals, meanwhile, exaggerate the economic performance of Nordic nations in an effort to justify welfare-state policies, while failing to acknowledge the role of freemarket policies in other areas.",

Overcrowded in automated, barren &quot;grow-out&quot; houses, turkeys are offered little opportunity to display their full range of complex social, foraging, and exploratory behavior. Today's commercial breeds grow at an unnaturally rapid pace to unprecedented weights. This forced rapid growth further compromises their health and welfare, and causes them to suffer from skeletal, muscular, and other health problems, as well as painful and often crippling leg disorders. Breeding birds, unable to mate naturally due to genetic selection for fast growth and excess breast muscle (meat), must be continuously feed-deprived in order to control weight. The catching, transport, and slaughter of turkeys subject them to stress, injury, and pain.",

        "content":"The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is charged with finding $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction measures. Whether these measures will reflect a balanced approach and rely on much needed revenue raisers is a subject of intense debate, and intense lobbying. The 12 members of Congress on this so-called &quot;supercommittee&quot; are facing intense, concentrated pressure from lobbyists and wealthy special interests representing major corporations and trade associations who are concerned about being asked to pay their fair share if the supercommittee closes corporate loopholes or fairly taxes top earners. Like many others, Wall Street and the financial sector will have a major stake in the committee's decisions. The sector has invested tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions to the 12 members of the supercommittee, as well as billions of dollars on lobbying over the past 11 years, according to a report from Public Campaign and National People's Action.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 12 members of the supercommittee have received at least $41 million from the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sector1 during their time in Congress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have received nearly $900,000 from three of the top American banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since 2000, the financial sector has spent over $4 billion lobbying elected officials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least 27 current or former aides to supercommittee members have worked as lobbyists for financial sector interests. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Will supercommittee members do what it takes to raise the revenue necessary or bow to the strong influence of their Wall Street backers?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  While Public Campaign does not take positions on specific revenues and cuts, it believes many policies do not receive a fair hearing in a political system dominated by special interest money, particularly campaign money from Wall Street CEOs, executives, and PACs.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  National People's Action calls on supercommittee members to raise a portion of the revenue we desperately need from Wall Street. Wall Street's actions drove the current recession and they need to pay to fix what they broke. In addition, over the last 30 years, the financial sector has grown exponentially and now comprises a much larger portion of our economy, yet the tax code does not reflect this reality, and the industry is now massively under-taxed.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Both organizations believe the unfair tax code is a direct result of a political system skewed to benefit those with the wherewithal to make large political donations and deploy armies of well-connected lobbyists.",

These conflicts have exacted a substantial toll on soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, and this toll goes beyond the well-publicized casualty figures. It extends to the stress that repetitive deployments can have on the individual servicemember and his or her family. This stress can manifest itself in different ways -- increased divorce rates, spouse and child abuse, mental distress, substance abuse -- but one of the most troubling manifestations is suicide, which is increasing across the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The increase in suicides among members of the military has raised concern among policymakers, military leaders, and the population at large. While DoD and the military services have had a number of efforts under way to deal with the increase in suicides among their members, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs asked RAND to review the current evidence detailing suicide epidemiology in the military, identify &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; suicide-prevention programs, describe and catalog suicide-prevention activities in DoD and across each service, and recommend ways to ensure that the activities in DoD and across each service reflect state-of-the-art prevention science.",

We also calculate the income tax consequences for &quot;representative&quot; taxpayers across these countries, and find that the differences in taxes between singles and married couples can often be quite large. We conclude that choosing the individual as the tax unit is likely to represent the most equitable approach to income taxation, especially given the increasing complexity of family units in modern societies.",

        "content":"Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI, is the signature wound of the Iraq War. It can be caused by bullets or shrapnel hitting the head or neck, but also by the blast injuries that often result from mortar attacks or roadside bombs. It is this second kind of injury that is especially prevalent in Iraq; about 65% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans wounded in action were injured by explosive devices. Overall, between 10 and 20% of Iraq veterans, or 150,000 and 300,000 people, have suffered a TBI during the war.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; TBI does not always cause an external wound; the pressure of a blast can overstretch or bruise the brain without leaving a visible trace. Moreover, the symptoms of TBI can be difficult to distinguish from combat stress and other related psychological injuries. Telltale signs of TBI include memory and emotional problems; vision, hearing, or speech problems; and sleep disorders. In addition, multiple mild TBIs can accumulate over time, leading to serious neurological problems that are not readily linked to one injury. As a result, TBI can often remain undiagnosed and untreated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; About 90% of TBIs are mild or moderate. But severe TBIs require a lifetime of care and rehabilitation. For the several thousand Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who have suffered this level of injury, the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs have developed a nationwide network of hospitals and clinics. There are four major Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, in Tampa, FL, Richmond, VA, Minneapolis, MN, and Palo Alto, CA. These centers are supported by dozens of regional sites across the country.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Although treatment is improving for veterans with severe TBI, TBI screening continues to lag. The Army has improved education for soldiers to help identify the symptoms of a mild TBI, and has begun to test troops' brain activity before their deployments to record baseline data. In spring 2007, the VA began to offer TBI evaluation to all Iraq and Afghanistan veterans seen at a VA hospital or clinic. Until a universal screening program is in place in the military, however, thousands of combat veterans will continue to struggle with the effects of an undiagnosed brain injury.",

In Massachusetts, 91 students drop out of high school each day. Nationally, and in our state, there has been much recent attention paid to the dropout crisis. One initiative being used by states in their efforts to reduce the dropout rate is to increase the compulsory attendance age to 18. In Massachusetts, the current compulsory attendance age is 16.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The passage of a new law in August 2008 led to the establishment of a state-level Graduation and Dropout Prevention and Recovery Commission in Massachusetts. The Commission is charged with making informed recommendations on ten issues, including whether or not the compulsory attendance age should be raised from 16 to 18.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Rennie Center's recent policy brief, entitled Raise the Age, Lower the Dropout Rate? Considerations for Policymakers, focuses on the question: Is there empirical evidence to support Massachusetts raising its compulsory school attendance age to 18?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Through an examination of research and analysis of other states' policies, the Rennie Center examines the arguments for and against raising the compulsory age of school attendance to 18 and concludes that there is no credible empirical evidence to support this policy alone as an effective strategy to combat the dropout crisis. The Center argues that prior to considering a raise in the compulsory age of attendance, the Commonwealth should focus its energy and resources on developing policies and programs that research has shown to be successful in helping at-risk students stay in school and persist to earning a diploma.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We recommend the following considerations for policymakers. Our hope is that this information will contribute to the current policy discussions focused on the issue of raising the age of compulsory school attendance in Massachusetts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider empirical evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address student disengagement and alienation from school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve attendance monitoring and early intervention systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase alternative education options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine and consider eliminating some of the existing exemptions that permit 14- and 15-year-olds to leave school prior to graduation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine and consider updating the current process for legally leaving school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine the fiscal impact of increasing the age of compulsory school attendance, including examination of: the cost of enforcement; funding outreach programs; increasing capacity to serve youth who would return to school; expansion and professional development of teacher workforce; expansion and professional development of school staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

The Act also can provide support for spurring economic recovery for a region hit hard by the BP Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010. Though much remains uncertain about how the Act will be funded and put to use, enough is clear to take stock of what the Act can do, what it will not do, and how affected communities and stakeholders might best engage the RESTORE Act process to ensure it fulfills its promise of a revitalized Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Given the unprecedented nature of the RESTORE Act and the hopes and expectations that many have for the Act, it is important to keep in mind what the Act will not and cannot be expected to do. Simply put, the Act does not address, much less solve, the deep ecologic challenges facing the Gulf of Mexico and its associated coastal ecosystems. Nor does it address the longstanding challenges to the sustainability and resilience of the communities of the region, many of which are tied to past and projected environmental trends in the coast and the Gulf. The Act can certainly improve conditions and create greater possibilities for the future, but it will take much more than RESTORE Act dollars to create the intellectual, civic, and financial capacity to achieve the goal of a Gulf and coast that are ecologically, culturally, and economically vibrant and sustainable. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Indeed, it is far more certain that the challenges of participating in the RESTORE Act process -- which will stretch on for some years -- and ensuring that the Act in fact lives up to its promise will put new demands on communities and stakeholders that the Act does not meet in any way. Those demands and the broader demands of creating sustainable communities and environments will likely have to be met by the sort of civic, academic, and philanthropic investment that helped make the RESTORE Act a plausible public investment.",

A Japanese woman reads a newspaper. Think of the objects you buy and use in any given day. Now, try to imagine that there are more than 1.7 billion human beings in the consumer society -- and their numbers are growing yearly. In many cases, excessive consumption burdens societies with bulging landfills, declining fish stocks, and rising obesity levels. Meanwhile, there are still another 2.8 billion who consume too little and who suffer from hunger, homelessness, and poverty. On the Worldwatch Institute's thirtieth anniversary, this special edition of State of the World examines how we consume, why we consume, and what impact our consumption choices have on the planet and our fellow human beings. From factory-farmed chicken to old-growth lumber to gas-guzzling cars, many of the things we buy support destructive industries. But businesses, governments, and concerned citizens can harness this same purchasing power to build markets for less-hazardous products, including fair-traded foods, green power, and fuel-cell vehicles. With chapters on food, water, energy, the politics of consumption, and redefining the good life, Worldwatch's award-winning research team asks whether a less-consumptive society is possible -- and then argues that it is essential.",

Perhaps this debate is so highly charged because it involves such fundamental issues. The calls for more gun restrictions or for bans on some or all guns are calls for significant change in our social and constitutional systems.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Gun control is based on the faulty notion that ordinary American citizens are too clumsy and ill-tempered to be trusted with weapons. Only through the blatant abrogation of explicit constitutional rights is gun control even possible. It must be enforced with such violations of individual rights as intrusive search and seizure. It most severely victimizes those who most need weapons for self-defense, such as blacks and women.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The various gun control proposals on today's agenda--including licensing, waiting periods, and bans on so-called Saturday night specials--are of little, if any, value as crime-fighting measures. Banning guns to reduce crime makes as much sense as banning alcohol to reduce drunk driving. Indeed, persuasive evidence shows that civilian gun ownership can be a powerful deterrent to crime.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The gun control debate poses the basic question: Who is more trustworthy, the government or the people?",

        "content":"The expansion of international trade has provided considerable benefits to the United States and its trading partners. Yet the growth of trade also raises concerns about its impact on domestic firms and their workers. This study surveys the economic research on the causes of expanded international trade, the benefits of trade, the impact of trade on employment and wages, and the cost of international trade restrictions. The findings include the following: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Income growth accounts for two-thirds of the growth in global trade in recent decades, trade liberalization accounts for one-quarter, and lower transportation costs make up the remainder. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade expansion has fueled faster growth and raised incomes in countries that have liberalized. A 1-percentage point gain in trade as a share of the economy raises per capita income by 1 percent. Global elimination of all barriers to trade in goods and services would raise global income by $2 trillion and U.S. income by almost $500 billion. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competition from trade delivers lower prices and more product variety to consumers. Americans are $300 billion better off today because of the greater product variety from imports. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International trade directly affects only 15 percent of the U.S. workforce. Most job displacement occurs in sectors that are not engaged in global competition. Net payroll employment in the United States has grown by 36 million in the past two decades, alongside a dramatic increase in imports of goods and services. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanding trade does not explain most of the growing gap between wages earned by skilled and unskilled workers. The relative decline in unskilled wages is mainly caused by technological changes that reward greater skills. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade barriers impose large, net costs on the U.S. economy. The cost to the economy per job saved in protected industries far exceeds the wages paid to workers in those jobs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

        "title":"Bridging the Organizational Divide -- The Making of a Nonprofit Merger",
        "content":"Nonprofit, community-based housing development organizations have only recently become significant players in the provision of affordable housing, at least in the United States. Historically, this job was left either in the hands of builders, developers, lenders and landlords of the business sector or in the care of agencies, planners and policymakers of the public sector. Only in the past 30 years has the provision of affordable housing moved beyond the familiar domains of the market and the state. A host of nonprofit organizations is now playing a larger role in constructing new housing, rehabilitating older housing, managing rentals and bringing home ownership within the reach of thousands of people for whom the American dream has proved elusive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The growth of these third-sector organizations has been both rapid and impressive, but it also has been uneven. Across the country, there are places where nonprofit housing development organizations are both plentiful and productive, supported by sophisticated networks of interorganizational collaboration, public funding, private financing and technical assistance. There are many other communities, however, where no nonprofits are engaged in affordable housing or where the ones that do exist are very new or very small, accounting for only a handful of new housing units every year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lying between these two extremes are those communities where multiple nonprofits of varying size serve a similar geographic area, each producing a modest but respectable number of housing units; each competing for constituents, funding and development opportunities; each struggling to survive. The organizations that find themselves in this uncomfortable situation often confront a special set of challenges. They are productive, but not prolific. They are effective, but not efficient. They are successful, but not sustainable. Indeed, they are frequently quite precarious. The loss of a single staff person, the delay of a single project or the adverse decision of a single funder can threaten not only their short-term chances for success, but their long term prospects for survival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Those who sponsor and fund such organizations sometimes find themselves in a situation where competition among multiple nonprofits is weakening them all. In these cases, the sponsoring and funding organizations have taken different tacks to address this problem. In some cases, they have acted to strengthen every nonprofit, while working to increase the division of labor or the division of territory among them. In other cases, they have acted to strengthen one (or more) nonprofit at the expense of the others, culling weaker performers from the herd.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While these have been the most common approaches for dealing with the weaknesses that organizational competition and duplication can sometimes create, a third alternative has been gaining ground. Multiple nonprofits, operating within the same jurisdiction, are being encouraged to collaborate -- even to the point of merging their programs, assets and hard-won identities.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Why is collaboration gaining in popularity? A financial explanation would be that it is becoming harder to find enough resources to strengthen every nonprofit to the same degree, funding multiple nonprofits to serve a similar clientele in the same locale. There is also the political reality that public and private funders find it difficult to choose easily (or accurately) which nonprofits should live -- and which should die. There is a practical explanation as well. Collaboration is becoming a strategy of choice simply because it is proving to be an unusually effective way of achieving greater productivity, efficiency and sustainability. When a collaborative (or a merger) is carefully crafted, the nonprofit partners do a better job together than they did apart. This is not true in every case, of course.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Read the full report for lessons in organizational matchmaking and the making of a nonprofit merger.",

        "content":"Philanthropists and governments have long used prizes to drive innovation and engagement to produce societal benefit, but the use of this powerful instrument is undergoing a renaissance. Philanthropic prizes are growing in number and size, are appearing in new forms, and are being applied to a wider range of societal objectives by a wider range of sponsors than ever before. Not all of the growth has been positive, however, as the many overlapping prizes and growing clutter of the sector attests. In response, current and potential participants are asking when they should use prizes, and how they can develop and deliver effective ones.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This report addresses these questions by drawing on academic literature, interviews with analysts and practitioners, surveys of prize sponsors and competitors, databases of small and large awards, and case studies of twelve effective prizes to produce lessons from a range of sectors, goals, and prize types. It aims to help improve current prizes and stimulate effective future use by developing a number of simple frameworks and compiling useful lessons for sponsors. While targeting the philanthropic sponsor, we believe these perspectives will also be helpful to governments and corporations considering prizes.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Our research found that prizes are a unique and powerful tool that should be in the basic toolkit of many of today's philanthropists. Their recent renaissance is largely due to a new appreciation for the multiple ways in which they can produce change: not only by identifying new levels of excellence and by encouraging specific innovations, but also by changing wider perceptions, improving the performance of communities of problem-solvers, building the skills of individuals, and mobilizing new talent or capital. These change drivers give prize sponsors compelling opportunities to use the open, competitive, and media-friendly attributes of prizes to stimulate attention and drive innovation in a highly leveraged and result-focused way. Recent prize growth is reinforced by powerful external trends such as the arrival of new philanthropic wealth, different attitudes to shifting risk, interest in open source approaches, and an increasingly networked, media-driven and technology-intensive world. We believe that the outlook for prizes is particularly strong because of the increased interest of philanthropists and the emergence of an industry of prize facilitators that is driving improvements in prize economics and improved practices for managing execution challenges and risks.",

MacArthur Foundation -- sought to better understand the country's mental health challenges and, in particular, the states' role in addressing them. The project found that:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2013, approximately 44 million adults -- 18.5 percent of the population 18 and older -- were classified as having a mental illness. Of these, 10 million had a serious mental illness. The rate of serious mental illness varied from state to state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2009, the most recent year for which national mental health data are available, $147 billion was spent on mental health treatment in the United States. A majority of the spending, 60 percent, came from public sources such as Medicaid, state and local governments, Medicare, and federal grants. Private sources, including health insurance and individual out-of-pocket spending, made up the difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funding from states and localities totaled $22 billion (15 percent) in 2009. This total does not include state and local Medicaid expenditures. Counting those contributions brings total state and local spending up to $35.5 billion (24 percent).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This report is intended to help federal, state, and local policymakers working to address the country's mental health challenges to better understand their prevalence, treatment, and funding trends.",

        "content":"Every year we see a new dimension of the ongoing Digital Revolution, which is enabling an abundance of information to move faster, cheaper, in more intelligible forms, in more directions, and across borders of every kind. The exciting new dimension on which the Aspen Institute focused its 2006 Roundtable on Information Technology was mobility, which is making the Digital Revolution ubiquitous. As of this writing, there are over two billion wireless subscribers worldwide and that number is growing rapidly. People are constantly innovating in the use of mobile technologies to allow them to be more interconnected. Almost a half century ago, Ralph Lee Smith conjured up &quot;The Wired Nation,&quot; foretelling a world of interactive communication to and from the home that seems commonplace in developed countries today. Now we have a &quot;Wireless World&quot; of communications potentially connecting two billion people to each other with interactive personal communications devices. Widespead adoption of wireless handsets, the increasing use of wireless internet, and the new, on-the-go content that characterizes the new generation of users are changing behaviors in social, political and economic spheres. The devices are easy to use, pervasive and personal. The affordable cell phone has the potential to break down the barriers of poverty and accessibility previously posed by other communications devices. An entire generation that is dependant on ubiquitous mobile technologies is changing the way it works, plays and thinks. Businesses, governments, educational institutions, religious and other organizations in turn are adapting to reach out to this mobile generation via wireless technologies -- from SMS-enabled vending machines in Finland to tech-savvy priests in India willing to conduct prayers transmitted via cell phones. Cellular devices are providing developing economies with opportunities unlike any others previously available. By opening the lines of communication, previously disenfranchised groups can have access to information relating to markets, economic opportunities, jobs, and weather to name just a few. When poor village farmers from Bangladesh can auction their crops on a craigslist-type service over the mobile phone, or government officials gain instantaneous information on contagious diseases via text message, the miracles of mobile connectivity move us from luxury to necessity. And we are only in the early stages of what the mobile electronic communications will mean for mankind. We are now &quot;The Mobile Generation.&quot; Aspen Institute Roundtable on Information Technology. To explore the implications of these phenomena, the Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program convened 27 leaders from business, academia, government and the non-profit sector to engage in three days of dialogue on related topics. Some are experts in information and communications technologies, others are leaders in the broader society affected by these innovations. Together, they examined the profound changes ahead as a result of the convergence of wireless technologies and the Internet. In the following report of the Roundtable meeting held August 1-4, 2006, J. D. Lasica, author of Darknet and co-founder of Ourmedia.org, deftly sets up, contextualizes, and captures the dialogue on the impact of the new mobility on economic models for businesses and governments, social services, economic development, and personal identity.",

        "content":"The OECD recently published a lengthy volume examining the causes of rising inequality in most wealthy countries over the last three decades. This paper examines that study, finding that the OECD misses most of the story of inequality because its primary focus is the ratio of the annual wage of the 90th percentile worker to the 10th percentile worker, while most of the benefits of rising inequality were concentrated much further up the income ladder. In contrast to the OECD, this paper finds that the impact of technology is negligible and actually trivially negative over the period examined. It also finds many errors in the use of data in the OECD's study, most importantly by exaggerating the number of independent observations when many of the data points are simply extrapolations. This causes the OECD to exaggerate the statistical significance of its findings. Finally, this paper suggests that the growth of the financial sector may have been an important factor contributing to the growth in inequality over the past 30 years.",

        "content":"The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution recognizes a laissez-faire policy toward speech and the press. The Framers of the Bill of Rights worried that the self-interest of politicians fostered suppression of speech. In contrast, some constitutional theorists have argued that the Constitution empowers, rather than restricts, the federal government to manage speech in order to attain the values implicit in the First Amendment. The government managed broadcast speech for some time, in part through the Fairness Doctrine, which was said to promote balanced public debate and &quot;an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.&quot; The history of the Fairness Doctrine confirms the validity of the concerns of the Framers of the First Amendment, because federal officials and their agents used and sought to use the Fairness Doctrine to silence critics of three presidencies. Broadcasters adapted to the Fairness Doctrine by avoiding controversial speech, thereby chilling public debate on vital matters. The Federal Communications Commission is proposing to manage broadcast speech by imposing localism requirements, including content requirements and advisory boards to oversee managing stations. This proposal limits the editorial independence of license holders to serve the public interest. The history of the Fairness Doctrine suggests that federal officials who make and enforce such policies are more concerned with limiting political debate than they are with advancing local concerns or the public interest. Like the Fairness Doctrine, the FCC's localism initiative poses the risk of restricting speech. Our unhappy experience with the Fairness Doctrine suggests that imposing localism mandates on broadcasters is unlikely to serve the public interest in constitutional propriety and uninhibited political debate.",

As a resource, the lakes and their tributaries are invaluable -- providing drinking water for 40 million people and serving as the region's economic and recreational lifeblood.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Yet, the sheer vastness of the lakes belies a fragility that policy-makers, scientists and other experts have struggled to address for more than a century . With less than 1 percent of the waters of the Great Lakes renewed annually through rainfall and snowmelt, the lakes are vulnerable to misuse and depletion.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Congress unanimously approved and President Bush signed the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact into law in October 2008. The eight-state water management pact is a first-of-its kind model for a consensus-based, basin-wide approach to decisions about how much and how far away Great Lakes water can be used. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The eight Great Lakes governors who collectively wrote and unanimously endorsed the pact deliberately left it to the states to devise their own rules of implementation for in-state water use. Since the compact's adoption, the Great Lakes states have developed water use standards that are much improved from what existed before, though many lack proactive policies designed to protect and nurture water sustainability. Meanwhile, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Council -- the body established by the compact to make decisions about water diversions outside the basin -- has not rendered binding rules for its review of diversion applications, leaving a void that may expose the pact to legal challenge and put Great Lakes water at risk.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The compact will soon face its first regional test from Waukesha, Wis., a community eligible to apply to divert Great Lakes water beyond the basin because of its location within a county straddling the Great Lakes and Mississippi River divide. The compact allows for straddling communities and communities within straddling counties not currently using Great Lakes water to be granted an exception to its ban on diversions -- but only if the community can prove no reasonable alternative water source exists and that the water will be returned to the basin. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Absent water-tight regional implementation rules, however, this precedent-setting application could reveal deficiencies in the application process that, if unaddressed, leave the compact vulnerable to legal challenges .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Waukesha is only the first of a number of communities that may line up for Great Lakes water in the coming decades. We encourage the Great Lakes governors to consider not only the implications of reviewing the Waukesha application under current guidance, but how the decisions made during this review will inevitably shape the basis for future decisions. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The first section of this report identifies a number of communities -- some similarly situated in straddling counties, others themselves straddling the border of the Great Lakes Basin -- that may face the need for an alternative water supply soon and could find requesting Great Lakes water a sensible prospect in the coming decade. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The second component of the report seeks to take advantage of a narrowing window of opportunity to fix shortcomings in the Compact Council review process; a window that will shut with the arrival of the first diversion request on its doorstep. The report analyzes Compact Council implementation deficiencies which, if not addressed, leave the application review process vulnerable to legal challenges that could reshape parts of the compact.",

Men and women looking for employment in open-air markets by the side of the road, at busy intersections, in front of home improvement stores and in other public spaces are ubiquitous in cities across the nation. The circumstances that give rise to this labor market are complex and poorly understood. In this report, we analyze data from the National Day Labor Survey, the first systematic and scientific study of the day-labor sector and its workforce in the United States. This portrait of day labor in the United States is based on a national survey of 2,660 day laborers. These workers were randomly selected at 264 hiring sites in 139 municipalities in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The sheer number of these sites, combined with their presence in every region in the country, reflects the enormous breadth of this labor market niche. Findings reveal that the day-labor market is rife with violations of workers' rights. Day laborers are regularly denied payment for their work, many are subjected to demonstrably hazardous job sites, and most endure insults and abuses by employers. The growth of day-labor hiring sites combined with rising levels of workers' rights violations is a national trend that warrants attention from policy makers at all levels of government.",

The short-term actions recommended are aimed at enabling the STS to make some minimum improvements in the organizational structures of the pilot offices and in moving the software into an operational mode so that its benefits can be realized.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  For the medium term the software developed by RNIVTS must be largely redesigned. The revised software should take full advantage of the capabilities of computers to take over most of the routine work of the tax inspectors. A self-assessment system, in which taxpayers fully complete their tax declarations without intervention by tax inspectors, must be introduced and the functional organization fully implemented in the pilot regions to complement the changes in the computer system. In other words, modernization of the STS goes beyond computerization. It will require reliance on a self-assessment system and the reorganization of the STS along functional lines.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  It should be noted that the team was not given access to the necessary statistical data, therefore the recommendations for the medium term are of a general nature only. In any case, specific recommendations are premature. The recommendations made in the report aim to improve the organizational structure and the decision-making process at the STS level. The recommendations focus on developing the necessary tools and conditions that will allow the STS to modernize its computer systems, procedures and field organization.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Working Paper Number 98-05.",

Recognizing the recent growth in girl-related attention and investment, ICRW undertook an initial mapping exercise in 2009 to understand more about the current landscape of &amp;quot;girl work&amp;quot; in the developing world. This paper presents the key findings from this exercise, describing what we have learned about the donors and organizations engaged in girl work, the policy and program efforts underway, and current and future directions for the field. It is hoped that the findings and considerations emerging from this mapping exercise will contribute toward a more strategic and coordinated effort to mobilize additional actors, resources and ideas on behalf of girls around the world",

The evidence, however, indicates that the issue is actually a lack of aggregate demand. Since accepting one of these views over the other will lead to very different policy solutions, it is important to accurately assess the cause of unemployment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This issue brief finds that the evidence is overwhelming consistent with the view that a lack of demand, caused by the collapse of the housing bubble is at the root of U.S. unemployment.

This tragic phenomenon reached new extremes when the Army reported a record-high number of suicides in July 2011 with the deaths of 33 active and reserve component service members reported as suicides. Additionally, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates 18 veterans die by suicide each day. Yet the true number of veterans who die by suicide, as Harrell and Berglass point out, is unknown. As more American troops return home from war, this issue will require increasingly urgent attention. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Harrell and Berglass present a number of concrete policy recommendations that will help reduce the number of service member and veteran suicides, including establishing an Army unit cohesion period; removing the congressional restriction on unit leaders discussing personally owned weapons with service members; and increasing coordination between the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve the analysis of veteran suicide data. Despite the efforts of the DOD and the VA to address military suicide, obstacles remain, and policymakers must bring a renewed urgency to their efforts if America is to both honor the sacrifices made by the all-volunteer force and protect its future health and ability to defend the nation.",

The enactment of the 1996 welfare law allows federal welfare funds to be spent on an array of pregnancy prevention activities and family planning services; furthermore, welfare funds are no longer limited to welfare recipients who receive grants -- funds may be spent on individuals who have never been a part of the welfare system. These fundamental policy changes, along with nearly $8 billion of unspent welfare funds, allow states to consider whether and how to invest in a range of strategies to prevent unintended pregnancy. The law permits, but does not require, any such investment. Nevertheless, a number of states are creating new ways to address unintended pregnancy. Some states are linking welfare offices and family planning services -- through co-location, information dissemination, referrals, case management, education, and training. Others are tapping welfare funds to provide education, information, or services to those who might never enter a welfare office. Some programs target adults, others teens; some include a focus on males. Making the Link seeks to provide insight into different types of links and how to make them work.",

Yes, say contributors to this guide, who have found ways to plan for exits upfront, clarify expectations with grantee organizations, and overcome the tensions that so often arise. Learn how to use the end of a funding relationship to boost a grantee's capacity, find new sources of support, and even multiply the value of the foundation's investment.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exit strategies used by four grantmakers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning from spend down foundations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you're the one who's exiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking the ice with new funders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's in the Guide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exiting Is Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; Saying goodbye to grantees is an inescapable part of the grantmaker's role. To do it well, our contributors told us, it's important to think upfront about an exit scenario that advances the aims of the grantee, the foundation, and the larger field. Put the exit on the table from the start, they said, and keep it there as a predictable phase in the funding relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating Clearly with Grantees: &lt;/strong&gt;For a grantee, the exit of a funder is always bad news, even when it's planned in advance. A grantmaker can set a positive tone by communicating consistently -- over the course of the grant and as the end approaches. When everyone at the foundation sends the same message, that's even better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening Grantees' Organizational Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Grantmakers often find themselves thinking hard about the future of a grantee organization as an exit approaches, especially if the grantee is relatively new, small, or unstable. Here are some ways to help: talk regularly with grantees about their organizational capacity, suggest using consultants for business planning and other services, and provide grants to pay for those services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping Grantees Find New Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, the bottom line. What grantees really want and need is help with fundraising. A matching or challenge grant can work well in the right situation, grantmakers said. Yet even without special funding, there are simple, powerful things you can do to put your grantees in touch with new funding prospects on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing the Impact of the Grant:&lt;/strong&gt; An exit can be an occasion to look back on what was accomplished, distill lessons, and disseminate what was learned. To let grantees do those things, some funders offer special support through transition or tie-off grants. Grantmakers' own efforts to strengthen the field can also extend the value of a foundation's investment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Cases: When the Exit Isn't Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; And then there's the exit where thinking upfront just doesn't apply: the exit where something goes seriously wrong or the funder's own situation changes dramatically. These are the cases that test a grantmaker's poise, acumen, and ingenuity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

        "content":"During the late 1990s, Colorado's Taxpayer's Bill of Rights was praised widely for its effectiveness in restraining the growth of government and providing tax relief for the residents of the state. TABOR capped government revenue growth at population plus inflation and mandated immediate rebates of surplus revenues. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Now TABOR is under attack by interest groups that want to increase government taxation faster than the cap will allow. They blame TABOR for the pressure the state budget has faced over the last four years. Yet that pressure is a direct result not of TABOR but of a recession, a drought, and a misguided educational-spending mandate that forced government to spend more money than it collected. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Opponents of TABOR have endorsed Referendum C as a much-needed fix to TABOR. However, far from simply tinkering with TABOR, Referendum C puts government growth in overdrive. The referendum would in effect give Colorado state government a blank check for the next five years. It would also permanently change the way the TABOR cap is calculated and lock in for perpetuity more government spending. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This paper sets the record straight on what really caused the budget problems in Colorado and what passage of Referendum C would mean to fiscal control in that state.",

The high adjustment scenario assumes that the U.S. trade deficit falls back to 1.0 percent of GDP by 2010.

        "content":"Intergovernmental fiscal relations may be the most contentious issue in the Russian Federation today. This is the result of the complexity of the problems intertwined with intergovernmental relations. These problems include the recent history of disintegration of the Soviet Union; the war in Chechnya; the ethno-linguistic, religious and historical differences across its vast territory; great variations in the endowment of mineral resources; increasingly large economic and fiscal disparities across regions and local governments; and the spreading sentiment in some regions that they can be better off by seceding from the Federation. It is not an overstatement to say that the survival of the Russian nation itself depends on the establishment of a system of intergovernmental fiscal relations that is functional and appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This document provides an in-depth analysis of the various dimensions of the Russian system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. Chapter I presents an introductory overview. Each subsequent chapter contains the discussion of a particular dimension of fiscal decentralization in the Russian Federation. The assignment of expenditure responsibilities in the Russian Federation is discussed and analyzed in Chapter II. Next, the assignment of tax revenues and other revenue issues, including tax administration and financial administration are considered in Chapter III. Chapter IV presents the use of intergovernmental transfers in the Russian system. Chapter V addresses the topics of subnational borrowing and emergency fiscal controls. Finally, Chapter VI reviews the main issues in policy formulation faced by the Russian government in their efforts to reform their system of intergovernmental fiscal relations.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Working Paper Number 99-03.",

Will it close the gaps between its citizens on education, health, earnings, and poverty, or will it continue to be listed as a city of disadvantage for African-Americans?

It could even be that the area's young people are starting to see the vibrant opportunities embedded in urban renewal and a low-cost of living, not to mention an expanding arts community, access to some of the nation's greatest educational institutions, and the chance to revel in the return of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the yellow towel industry that goes with it.",

Just as physical assets were used to finance the creation of more physical assets during the industrial age, intangible assets should be used to finance the creation of more intangible assets in the information age. Intangible assets show up in the financial system in various ways. They are valued -- often implicitly, sometimes explicitly -- in financial markets by analysts, in stock prices, in ratings by credit agencies and for private lender programs.

        "title":"Making the Leap from College to the Nonprofit Sector",
        "content":"It's your senior year and campus is abuzz, but this year there's a different feel. Everywhere you turn there's a career fair. Recruiters have blown into town and they're interviewing everyone in their path. Your roommates are mulling offers from Fortune 500 companies and even friends in the community service club are comparing sign-on bonuses. You, however, have never pictured yourself working for a paycheck in a huge corporation. You've always wanted to do something you feel passionate about; something that impacts your community and serves a greater good. You've been steering straight towards the nonprofit sector. However, the pressure is on to get a job. Graduation is around the corner, student loan bills are on their way and the last thing you want to do is move back home with your parents.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then welcome to the crossroads of your real world responsibilities and your \"save the world sensibilities.\" Though the challenge may seem daunting, success is within reach. But before you hit send on your first application, you'll need to develop a strategy and employ the right techniques to land an amazing job in the nonprofit sector. Take a deep breath. You've got a lot of work to do if you're going to change the world.\n\nStep 1: Find your inspiration\n\nChances are your interest in the nonprofit sector and your passion for social impact didn't happen overnight. A successful nonprofit job search strategy starts with a solid self assessment of your interests and inspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat issues do you feel strongly about?\n\n\n\nWas there a particular book, teacher or class that first sparked your interest?\n\n\n\nWould you be happier as a front line soldier or a behind the scenes catalyst?\n\n\n\nWould it be more satisfying for you to help one child succeed, or to affect high-level policy change?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it's the environment, immigrant rights, or school reform, it may take some digging to find the roots of your social consciousness. While this effort is essential in crafting an effective nonprofit job search, you can't merely rest on your idealism. \"The candidates that are most successful in making the leap from college to the nonprofit sector aren't just do-gooders,\" says Allyson Biegeleisen, Director of Client Service at Commongood Careers. \"They're passionate about particular issues and they've demonstrated that passion in their academics, extra curricular activities and volunteer work.\" In short, find your passion and turn it into action.\n\nIt can be helpful to explore your motivations for working in the nonprofit sector by hearing about what has inspired others. Check out the publication Be Bold which profiles 12 social entrepreneurs and details the inspirations and qualities that drive them to continually broaden their impact and change the world.\n\nStep 2: Research organizations\n\nNow that you've uncovered your motivations for working in the nonprofit sector, it's time to put those research skills you've spent 4 years sharpening to work. Find the organizations that would be perfect match for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse online resources to identify nonprofits you may want to work for. Idealist.org and Charity Navigator, and Guidestar are good sites to start with, as they have detailed profiles for thousands of nonprofits throughout the world.\n\n\n\nRead up on news and trends in the sector at such sites as The Foundation Center and The Nonprofit Times.\n\n\n\nTalk to your school's career center and your professors. There is often an overlap between academia and the nonprofit sector, and many professors serve as board members, policy advisors or supporters of nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n\nBased on this research, create a target list of 5-10 organizations that you would love to work for.\n\n\n\nThen, scour the websites of the organizations on your target list and find the titles and responsibilities of their entry-level positions. Through this, you can identify specific positions to focus on and when you're ready to apply you can tailor your resume and cover letter according to the responsibilities and qualifications of the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Get out there!\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase, \"It's not what you know, but who you know?\" It's as true in the nonprofit sector as it is in any facet of your life, maybe more so. Due to a lack of resources to recruit on campus and run far-reaching talent searches, nonprofits leaders rely heavily on their networks and referrals to find great talent. Unlike your classmates who are pursuing corporate job opportunities, nonprofit jobseekers typically don't have the luxury of setting up on-campus interviews through campus career centers. You'll need to proactive to find the perfect fit. Building your network involves a combination of your social skills and your know-how.\n\nNetworking: Start within your age group and other people that have recently made the jump into the nonprofit sector. This group is most able to relate to your situation and will have the most relevant advice for jumping the hurdles that stand in your path. The Young Nonprofit Professionals Network (YNPN) is a membership organization that creates opportunities for the young people in the sector to connect and network with their peers. From there, work outwards and upwards to network with leaders in the nonprofit sector. For more detailed advice on networking, read our article Its Who You Know: Networking for Jobseekers.\n\nVolunteering: Every nonprofit in some capacity or another relies on volunteers to accomplish their mission. Find volunteer opportunities with the 5-10 organizations on your target list and get involved today. Fundraising events are generally a good starting place to volunteer and they present an excellent opportunity to network with staff, funders and other volunteers of your target organizations. Also, call each organization directly and ask if there are any volunteer opportunities in their offices. Most nonprofits will not turn down help, and there's often the largest need in the development and programming departments.\n\nMentors: In your networking and volunteer work, keep an eye out for potential mentors to act as go-to people for advice and council. Another technique for finding a mentor involves a bit more action. Find the person in the sector that has your dream job and contact them. Let them know that you'd someday like to be where they are now, and you'd like to speak to them about their career path. If they're amenable, schedule a meeting or an in-person informational interview. It may seem like a scary proposition to cold call someone you don't know, but you'd be amazed how helpful and open successful professionals in the nonprofit sector are. In developing these relationships, remember to take it slow and state your intentions. Start with an email, then a call and then a meeting. The key is to get out in the community now, impress everyone you meet and be upfront about your goal of finding a job in the nonprofit sector. Through this, you'll soon have a team of supporters and advocates to help you accomplish your goal.\n\nConclusion\n\nMaking the jump from undergrad to the nonprofit sector may be easier than you think. You can drastically increase your chances of landing that perfect job by creating a strategy, understanding your passion, researching organizations, networking and getting involved. Before you even submit your first application you'll be half way there. You may not be saving the world tomorrow, but you'll be on your way to making a big impact, one footprint at a time.\n\nHey college seniors: don't see yourself working for a paycheck in a huge corporation? You want to do something you feel passionate about; something that impacts your community and serves a greater good? You've been steering straight towards the nonprofit sector....",

As a result, many young adults are earning less than their parents did, even as childcare and education costs continue to soar.

The organization primarily seeks out artistically accomplished young people throughout the United States and gives them national recognition through cash awards and scholarships. It also encourages artistic growth and career development through workshops, public performances and exhibitions, and internships, and serves as a springboard for successful careers in the arts.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nThe ARTS initiative, established twenty-five years ago, is the nation's only scholarship program in all art forms for young people ages 17 and 18 -- primarily high school seniors. They are judged against a standard of excellence for their age group within their artistic discipline, and do not compete against each other. The organization brings those selected to participate in ARTS Week -- 160 this year -- to Miami each January for an all-expenses-paid week of master classes, showcase performances, exhibitions, interdisciplinary activities, enrichment programs, interviews, and live auditions. Those deemed most talented receive individual cash awards up to $10,000, or a total of $525,000, and are eligible for $3 million in college scholarships. Later, as ARTS alumni, they may receive grants up to $600 and are eligible for internships to the Sundance Theatre Laboratory or the Utah Shakespearean Festival at Southern Utah University. NFAA also supports professional and emerging artists through career development programs such as Astral Career Grants. The organization is the exclusive nominating agency, through its ARTS program, of up to fifty young people for the Presidential Scholars in the Arts, a national recognition program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe ARTS program dominates the NFAA Web site, which contains a searchable list of current award winners, and past winners, by state and discipline; the requirements within each category in a specific art form; eligibility information; specifics on the ARTS Alumni Awards, including past winners and an application; and a link to the ARTS alumni homepage. The NFAA site also provides information on the $25,000 Music for Youth Foundation scholarships and the Arison Award, given annually to an individual who has significantly influenced the development of young American artists, and accompanied by a $10,000 donation to the winner's arts organization or charity of choice; links to opportunities for artists in various fields; a timeline of NFAA history; and upcoming events.\n\n\nFunding:\nNFAA is supported primarily by gifts from individuals, corporations, foundations, and other philanthropic institutions.

        "content":"The Volunteer Revolution can be a motivational read for anyone who is looking to serve their church, but is not quite sure where to start. It can also be a stimulating resource for church leaders who manage volunteers. Written from a Christian perspective by Bill Hybels, a pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, this book draws largely from his experience in recruiting church volunteers, and, from the outset, he declares: \"I have never done a single thing of value without the assistance of others.\"\n\nIn one important chapter entitled \"Just Jump In,\" Hybels urges his readers to take the initiative in creating their experiences of church volunteering by assessing and using their spiritual gifts. However, Hybels fails to explain what he means exactly by \"spiritual gifts\" and how they differ from ordinary gifts. His book assumes readers at least have heard of \"spiritual gifts,\" but those unacquainted with this concept may get frustrated as they keep reading, since Hybels states clearly how important it is to the foundation of church ministry: \"I felt strongly about starting from the point of spiritual giftedness, because early in my ministry I discovered what happens when you don't.\"\n\nWhether or not one understands \"spiritual gifts,\" one concept that Hybels drives home is the importance of passion in one's church ministry. He believes that volunteers should serve not only where they are most needed, but also where they feel most passionate about service. For example, he describes how one woman converted her love for hairdressing into a ministry when she opened a salon that hosts an occasional \"Day of Beauty\" providing hairstyles, makeovers, and manicures to women in hardship.\n\nWhile Hybel's book offers reasonable encouragement to prospective church volunteers, more information about how they can deal with challenges to church service, such as church politics and bureaucracy, would have been useful. However, to his credit, Hybels does acknowledge that churches can sometimes be slow to tap into talents present in their congregations, and he urges volunteers to exercise persistence in finding their niche in the church. It also would have been enlightening to find more examples here of how a church ministry doesn't just entail serving the actual church, but could involve a \"road ministry\" in which stewards do the work of God in ways and places outside of the physical church.\n\nOverall, this well-meaning book may just provide the incentive that volunteers need in order to plunge into the world of church ministry, and will hopefully spark more literature and discussions on this subject.\n\nFor citations to additional materials on this topic refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject heading \"Voluntarism-administration.\"\n\nWritten from a Christian perspective by Hybels, a pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, the book draws largely from his experience in recruiting church volunteers, and can be a motivational read for anyone who is looking to serve their church but is not quite sure where to start, or a stimulating resource for church leaders who manage volunteers.....",

        "title":"A Memoir of the Ford Foundation: The Early Years",
        "content":"A dozen years into a new century, and with the Ford Foundation announcing eight- and nine-figure grants in support of leadership and documentary film initiatives, global human rights groups in the Southern Hemisphere, and expanded learning time in public schools, it might surprise some to learn that the second-largest foundation in the U.S. was launched in 1936 as a corporate foundation with a modest endowment of $25,000.\n\nMuch has changed in the decades since, both in the world and at the foundation, which has been shaped as much by postwar geopolitical shifts as by a succession of ambitious executives and the financial resources left it by Henry Ford and his only child, Edsel. In a just-published memoir, one of those executives, Verne S. Atwater, with help from fellow Ford alum Evelyn C. Walsh, leads readers through his tenure at the foundation and shares his memories of the people who directed Ford and its groundbreaking programs during a period when it was by far the largest foundation in the country and arguably the most influential.\n\nAtwater, who worked in banking and academia before joining Ford, served as the foundation's first vice president of administration in which role he was responsible for overseeing construction of the foundation's landmark headquarters building on East 43rd Street in Manhattan. He also worked with many of the program directors who helped develop and promote the foundation's international education and arts programs, its critical support for the agriculturally focused development effort known as the Green Revolution, and any number of efforts to promote democracy and \"advance human welfare\" around the globe.\n\nAs is often the case, context is crucial. Atwater was at Ford from 1956 to 1968  a period during which the foundation's work was very much influenced by the work of the Gaither Study Committee. Chaired by H. Rowan Gaither (who would serve as the foundation's president from 1953 to 1956), the committee, at the behest of Henry Ford II, issued a report in 1949 that was the basis for many of its initiatives over the succeeding decades. In those early postwar years, anti-communism was the political flavor of the day, and the foundation, eager to counteract the perception that its programs might be providing aid and comfort to Communists, responded by severing its ties to the Fund for the Republic.\n\nThe Gaither committee and its report also drew on the insights of many of the people who helped develop the Marshall Plan. One of them, Paul Hoffman, who directed the Economic Cooperation Administration set up by the U.S. government in 1948 to administer the plan, was chosen by Henry Ford II to take over as president of the foundation. Hoffman subsequently played a critical role in the foundation's decision to open offices in India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia. Similarly, John J. McCloy, U.S. High Commissioner for Germany from 1949 to 1952, chaired the foundation's board from 1958 to 1965.\n\nAtwater admits to a degree of naivet in terms of what he was getting involved in by following his mentor, Thomas Carroll, dean of the business school at Syracuse University, to the foundation. \"In the euphoria of my youthful...postwar expectations, I almost missed the small signs that the work of the foundation to 'advance human welfare' would be more difficult to achieve than perceived by the authors of the [Gaither] study report,\" Atwater writes. \"They would be encumbered by the limitations, frailties, and ambitions of the men and women who guided its affairs as officers, program directors, staff, advisors, and grantees.\"\n\nHe had plenty of opportunity during his time at the foundation to observe his fellow executives in action, however, and he does a fine job of giving his readers a sense of what it was like to be at the center of things during those heady years. Most of his portrayals are affectionate, and major disagreements between colleagues are downplayed. Especially touching is his portrait of Henry Heald, who resigned as president of New York University to take over from Gaither as president of the foundation and whose management innovations were often a departure from the way things had been done at the foundation. Atwater tells us, for example, that in previous administrations program officers had been able to slip a grant proposal directly to the board for approval. Heald, who graced the cover of TIME magazine in June 1957, ended that practice. Similarly, while foundation policy before Heald's arrival limited a program officer's tenure to five years and made frequent use of consultants and short-term program specialists, Heald believed that allowing program officers to stay longer contributed to a more stable management environment.\n\nThe board, however, did not always agree with Heald's decisions, and after nine years it decided not to renew his contract. \"He was hurt and bitter about the decision,\" Atwater writes. Years later, Heald \"was still resentful, lonely, and sad as I presented him with a small picture I had seen in his office over the years. He appreciated it and thanked me for remembering him and the picture.\" Atwater's disappointment, all these years later, over the fact that Heald, a man he admired, died before seeing the fruits of the initiatives launched during his tenure including the foundation's support for the Green Revolution and the construction of its world-famous headquarters building is palpable.\n\nAtwater also served the foundation in Argentina, overseeing education programs there, and traveled extensively to check on and consult with staff members working in India, Asia, and the Middle East travels that gave him a unique perspective on Ford's role in said Green Revolution. As Atwater describes it, the effort grew out of conversations between George Harrar, then president of the Rockefeller Foundation and the man responsible for selecting agronomist Norman Borlaug to lead the foundation's development efforts in Mexico, and Forrest \"Frosty\" Hill, Ford's vice president of overseas development and an agricultural economist who had previously chaired the department of agriculture at Cornell University. Most days, Harrar and Hill took the train from Scarsdale into New York City, and it was during those shared commutes that they realized they could achieve more working as partners than as friendly rivals. Subsequently, the two foundations collaborated during the 1960s to bring Borlaug's work in Mexico to India, the Philippines and other parts of Asia one of the signal philanthropic achievements of the twentieth century.\n\nIndeed, the tale of commuting friends who helped conceive an effort that improved the lives of a billion people around the globe is just one of many wonderful stories shared by Atwater and Walsh. Less a comprehensive history of the Ford Foundation than an impressionistic behind-the-scenes account of what it was like to work at the foundation as it rose to international prominence, A Memoir of the Ford Foundation: The Early Years is a splendid addition to the growing literature about twentieth-century philanthropy and ably demonstrates that philanthropy, while an inherently personal endeavor, has the potential to exceed even our grandest expectations.\n\nA new memoir about the early history of the Ford Foundation describes its support of leadership and documentary film initiatives, global human rights groups in the Southern Hemisphere, and expanded learning time in public schools, as well as its launch in 1936 as a corporate foundation with a modest endowment of $25,000...",

        "title":"The Ten Immutable Laws of the (Fundraising) Universe",
        "content":"In my years of working with a wide range of nonprofit organizations, I've learned that the universe of fundraising can be described by certain \"laws,\" much as the physical universe is described by certain provable statements. Tested by experience, observation, and results, these laws of fundraising determine to a large extent the success of our efforts. If your capital campaign has stalled, your funding proposals routinely go unfunded, or your board has stopped working effectively, the laws described below may point you toward a solution.\n\nLaw #1: No group of individuals is waiting to give (also known as the Law of the Nonexistent They).\n\nThe idea of such a group is a legend raised to the status of myth among board members, executive management, and volunteers. Capital campaign planning meetings, program development meetings, and fund development committee discussions are frequently dominated by the refrain \"They will give.\" \n\nUnfortunately, this myth is dangerous to sound organizational and fundraising practice because it leads to two misconceptions: 1) prospect research, identification, cultivation, and solicitation are not necessary because they will give out of the goodness of their hearts; and 2) although we are too_______________ (poor, overcommitted, overworked, fill in the blank) to contribute to our cause, they are perfectly positioned with abundant resources, time, and energy to ensure its success.\n\nImplicit in the Law of the Nonexistent They is a simple fact: Anonymous individuals who have little or no connection to your organization are not waiting in line to give you money. Yes, many people will invest in your organization  if you give them reason. But the mysterious they are not among those prospects. Instead, organizations must rely on \"we\"  that is, you and I and those willing to join us. And if we have only ourselves and those whom we can convince to join us, then we had better get started. The best place to begin is with our second law.\n\nLaw #2: Fundraising is a conversation between funded and funder.\n\nMarketing, in its purest form, is a conversation between someone with something to offer and someone who is interested in the thing that's being offered. And fundraising is simply a form of marketing in which the conversation is expressed in actions rather than words. The funder participates in this conversation by providing financial resources, credibility, and, sometimes, social or political connections. The nonprofit organization seeking funding participates by providing something of value, be it a social service, a solution for a critical community need, or a seat at the policy table. Either side may discontinue the conversation at any time. \n\nAs we have seen, the Nonexistent They are not party to the conversation between organization and funder. People who do not know your organization and are not known by it will not invest in your mission. This is why fundraisers identify prospects, cultivate their interest, develop their connection to the organization, and, last but not least, ask for that investment. \n\nMoreover, the conversation between funders and fundraisers is how communities hold nonprofit organizations to account. The community, represented by individual donors or institutions, directs its philanthropic resources to organizations it deems to be effective and accountable and withholds its resources from those it deems to be less effective or accountable. That's why it is so important to heed our third law.\n\nLaw #3: Effective fundraising is a result of telling your story.\n\nFunders invest in nonprofit organizations able to make a well-conceived case for support that includes clear goals and measurable outcomes. \n\nTelling your story involves more than making the case in a funding proposal or during a funder visit. Our third law tells us that we must take advantage of every opportunity to enhance the visibility of our organizations. And visibility, in this context, is just another word for publicity. There's a saying among professional fundraisers: \"You can have publicity without fundraising, but you can't have fundraising without publicity.\" Publicity includes press releases, newsletters, annual reports, annual appeals, audio-visual aids, and every other form of printed or produced collateral. But other forms of publicity are also important. Having your board chair call a foundation to introduce your nonprofit is a form of publicity; arranging to have exhibiting artists meet your supporters at the local art event is a form of publicity; getting your supporters to tour the new hospital wing is a form of publicity. Any activity that puts a face on a community need, illustrates your mission in human terms, or otherwise imbues your organization with a personality can be considered publicity. Our fourth law tells us why the ability to \"personalize\" your organization dramatically increases its chances of success.\n\nLaw #4: People give to people.\n\nRare is the seasoned fundraising professional who has not observed this law in action. Fundraisers know that worthy causes alone \"feed the hungry,\" \"shelter the homeless,\" \"care for the sick\"  do not raise money. Presented as abstractions, they often raise more questions than they answer. That's why we say that people give to people.\n\nA word of caution. Humans are inherently social animals; we care about and spend enormous amounts of time and energy creating and maintaining social networks. If people give to people, then the role of the fundraiser is to create relationships. However, fundraisers must be careful. Friendships between fundraisers and prospects are usually fleeting, lasting only as long as the fundraiser is employed by that organization. Indeed, professional ethics dictate that the organization's prospects and donors stay with the organization, not with the fundraiser. The truly successful fundraising professional is able to establish relationships on behalf of the organization that continue well beyond his or her departure from the organization. Once a relationship has been established, it's time to move to the next step.\n\nLaw #5: Someone must ask for the money.\n\nGifts are solicited; they do not come in over the transom. And yet this simple fact often is the hardest one for fundraisers to accept. Indeed, we will do practically anything to avoid asking for the money. Sitting at the table with a prospect, having worked hard to make a compelling case for support, many a clear-headed fundraiser will neglect to say, \"Now, Harriet, we're talking about $50,000 a year for the next five years. Can you do that?\" Or a grantwriter will submit an elaborately detailed proposal without including a statement that says \"We are seeking an award of x dollars for y purposes,\" leaving the reviewer to scratch her head and wonder, \"How much do they want and for what?\" \n\nIt bears repeating: The individual prospect or foundation will rarely venture an offer of a gift. It is the role of the fundraiser to seek the gift. And the key to success is to ask in a manner that respects both the donor and the gift, which brings us to our sixth law.\n\nLaw #6: An organization cannot thank a donor enough.\n\nExpressions of gratitude are expressions of respect. Every appeal letter, every funding proposal, every individual solicitation to a recurring donor should include a reference to his or her previous contributions of time, money, and advice. Many organizations establish hard-and-fast policies governing gift acknowledgements. A good one is to send at least initial acknowledgement of a gift within forty-eight hours of its receipt. Another good one is to require more than one thank-you for gifts over a certain amount. For larger gifts, the development officer should send the initial typed response, followed by a thank-you from the CEO a few days later; for really significant gifts, the chair of the board might send a third thank-you a day or so after the CEO. Overkill? Perhaps, but ask yourself this: \"If this donor stops giving, can we replace the gift?\" In cases where the answer to that question is \"no,\" then earnest and sincere gratitude is not overkill.\n\nIn the for-profit world, good customer-relations managers are famous for their maniacal devotion to the words \"thank you.\" They understand that their costumers usually have a plethora of options from which to choose. The same holds true for funders. And that brings us to law number seven.\n\nLaw #7: Seek investments, not gifts.\n\nMaking a gift to a nonprofit organization is nearly always seen as an investment by the funder or donor and almost never understood as such by the organization. When an organization asks for a gift  \"Please give us a grant to accomplish such-and such an outcome\"  the organization, whether it knows it or not, is seeking a one-sided exchange of values. In contrast, when an organization seeks an investment  \"Please invest in our organization so that together we can accomplish such-and-such an outcome\"  it invites the funder or donor to share responsibility for the desired outcome. By changing the paradigm, the organization alters both the perception of the ask and, as our eighth law tells us, the manner in which funders and donors are treated. \n\nLaw #8: Donors are developed, not born.\n\nAll donors have three characteristics in common: a connection to your organization, interest in its success, and the ability to give. The process of nurturing these three characteristics is called \"donor development.\"That's why most fundraising functions in nonprofit organizations are grouped under the rubric of \"development.\" And the best way to describe the process of moving an individual to the point of making a gift is using a model known as the \"Five Eyes of Donor Development.\"\n\nTo fully appreciate the power of the \"Five Eyes\"  Identification, Information, Interest, Involvement, and Investment  you need to think about individuals as operating within Circles of Influence. The closer to the center of the circle a person gets, the greater the influence that person may have on an organization and, conversely, the greater the influence the organization may wield over that person. To illustrate, draw a small circle on a sheet of paper. Next, draw three concentric circles around that circle. Now imagine a core group of people within the smallest circle. Those are your stakeholders  so called because they have a personal stake in the success of your organization. The second circle is occupied by donors  people or institutions that have a connection to your organization and contribute regularly to its mission. The third circle is occupied by prospects  individuals or institutions that have shown interest in supporting your organization. And the last circle is populated by \"possibilities\"  so called because you believe those individuals have possibilities for becoming prospects and donors.\n\nNow, the world is full of possibilities. To turn them into prospects, however, you have to identify their connection to, interest in, and ability to give to your organization. Prospects, in turn, need information about your organization as much as you need information about them. From information comes interest  that with which we become familiar. People tend to become involved in that which interests them. And investment follows involvement as surely as night follows day. Thus, the \"Five Eyes\" remind us to focus our efforts on moving each occupant of a \"circle\" closer to the center. In this way, possibilities become prospects who become donors. \n\nHere's the interesting thing: As donors move closer to the \"inner circle,\" their gifts will grow. No one invests all of his or her money in a single stock or company; by the same token, no donor makes his or her largest investment in a nonprofit with his or her first gift. By establishing a strong connection with donors, we develop their interest in our organization's success and enhance their ability (desire) to give. And as we continue to match the needs of our organization with their needs, our donors will continue to make larger gifts, until they make the ultimate gift. Then our attention turns to stewardship and maintaining their satisfaction with and involvement in our organization. This leads us to our ninth law.\n\nLaw #9: Fundraising out of desperation is futile.\n\nContrary to what many people believe, contributions of cash are rarely offered because an organization is desperate. Desperate organizations are often perceived to be unstable, incapable of doing the work, and just plain bad investments. The successful organization, in contrast, is able to tell a story characterized by accomplishment, sound financial management, and visionary leadership. \n\nOf course, all organizations raise money out of need. By itself, however, \"We need money\" is rarely compelling enough to convince a prospect to offer his or her support. Instead, your grant proposals, appeal letters, and kitchen conversations must say in no uncertain terms, \"We're winners! We can do the job! Back us!\" \n\nOur ninth law holds true not only for desperate organizations but also for desperate causes. A case for support that speaks only to the misery of your constituency will often backfire. People, being people, tend to become resentful when they're made to feel guilty. Take care that your prospects do not become so numbed by the magnitude of the problem that they miss the real improvements created by your efforts. Donors will give year after year, in increasing amounts, if you can convince them that you have a plan and the leadership and financial means to execute that plan.\n\nLaw #10:In the best of circumstances, people will do what they please (also known as the Law of Uncertainty).\n\nAs I hope I've been able to show, fundraising is the art of establishing and strengthening relationships between prospective donors and your organization. But because humans just may be the most unpredictable species in the world, fundraising is anything but an exact science, and its immutable laws are, well, mutable. To quote one of my mentors, Sy Seymour: \"On your best day, when you've spoken all the golden words you know, when you've matched the right gift to the right prospect for the right cause and had the right person ask...people will do what they please.\" Given this most basic fact of the fundraising universe, our only recourse as fundraisers is to \"keep on keeping on.\" Perseverance, not speed, will win this race. \n\nThe Law of Uncertainty helps even the most seasoned fundraisers and development officers accept the rejections that are an inevitable aspect of their job. In fundraising, such rejections are rarely, if ever, personal. In fact, \"no\" is often a veiled request for more information. If a prospect says \"no,\" don't be afraid to ask \"Why?\"Knowing the reasons behind that \"no\" will prove invaluable the next time you make your case to that donor. \n\nI hope the laws described above provide you with some insights into the unique and always fascinating dynamics of fundraising. A solid understanding of those dynamics will help you to develop fundraising programs that bear fruit and secure a strong financial future for your organization. In future columns, I will consider many other aspects of the sustainable nonprofit, including strategic planning, fundraising campaigns, and executive leadership transitions.

According to The Simple Truth About the Gender Gap 2013 Edition (28 pages, PDF), the pay gap ranges from 10 percent in Washington, D.C., to 33 percent in Wyoming. Indeed, even after taking into consideration age, marital status, geographic region, college major, GPA, type of undergraduate institution, institution selectivity, occupation, and hours worked, the report found a 7 percent differential in the earnings of men and women just one year after graduation. The report also found that the gender gap in median weekly earnings was wider among Asian Americans than other races/ethnicities, and among men and women between the ages of 35 and 64 than among younger or older cohorts. Moreover, given that the incomes of married women account for 36 percent of family income in a typical household  up from 29 percent in 1983  and that 34 percent of working mothers are their families' sole breadwinners, the pay gap is not simply a women's issue, the report argues, it's a family issue.",

While there is great variety among organizations  in terms of budget size, area of service, location, and scope of activity  one theme appears to stand out: More than 80 percent of the 6,500 nonprofits surveyed reported a new or renewed focus on the effective development of programs and services.\n\n\"In many ways, 2012 could be called 'The Year of Program'. Nonprofits of all sizes and types are taking a serious and fresh look at what they offer and how they serve the public through their programs,\" said Gayle A. Brandel, president and CEO of Professionals for NonProfits. Moreover, the renewed focus on programs and services is expressed in four inter-related areas: development, delivery, evaluation, and efficiency.\n\n1. A growing number of nonprofits  a third of the respondents to the 2012 survey  are working deliberately to refresh their offerings, both in terms of new, innovative programming and by reinstating programs and services that had been cut back over the past few years. Accompanying, and often driving, these programmatic developments is a growing awareness of the need for good analyses of the market. Forward-looking nonprofits are acting on the realization that it is no longer enough to offer a program or service and expect an audience to respond positively  regardless of how much it might merit it. Building a better mousetrap is no guarantee that people will rush to embrace your product. First, you have to determine whether they want to catch mice!\n\n2. Increasingly, nonprofits are exploring and adopting new ways of delivering programs and services. The use of social media is a prime example. New channels of communication create new opportunities  and challenges  for the effective delivery of programs and services.\n\n3. Integrated with these trends is a growing interest in evaluation and assessment. Nonprofits are asking: How do we know our program initiatives are working? And how do we measure their impact? In the face of reduced government funding, lower revenue, increased competition for visibility and support, and the need to engage volunteers, members, and boards, this is a critical issue. Identifying and using appropriate instruments for data gathering, analysis, and assessment will be an ongoing concern for nonprofit organizations in 2013  and beyond.\n\n4. Correlated with improved program development, delivery, and evaluation is a growing concern for increased organizational efficiency. \"Less can be more\" is a mantra we hear often these days, and the 2012 Survey Report reflects that reality.\n\nThe effect of all these trends on staffing needs in the sector is significant. The report found that 33 percent of the nonprofits who responded said they added staff in 2012, while more than 37 percent said they plan to hire additional staff in 2013.\n\nIndeed, with a stronger focus on improved delivery of core programs, heightened visibility for those programs, and new and improved ways to secure financial support, nonprofits are adding staff in three key, and inter-related, areas: Programs and Services (54 percent), Fundraising and Development (39 percent), and Marketing (35 percent).\n\nAnd we project these trends will continue in 2013, making it even more definitively \"The Year of Program Growth.\"\n\nFor a breakdown of Salary Survey responses by region/metro area (i.e., NYC, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.), visit the PNP Web site (registration required).\n\nRobert F. Duvall, director of special projects at Professionals for NonProfits, provides an overview of its just-released annual Salary Survey Report, and predicts trends in nonprofit hiring and operations through the rest of 2013....",

        "content":"If you slept through your high school and college history classes and have no idea how John Winthrop, James Madison, and W. E. B. DuBois relate to America's nonprofit sector, you'll want to stop reading and immediately order this book. Indeed, editor David Hammack has compiled a selection of readings that every nonprofit professional, policymaker, student of the sector, and volunteer will want to have on their bookshelf.\n\nThe readings are arranged chronologically, with section one devoted to illustrating the profound effect that religious and governmental leaders in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America had in shaping the country's nascent nonprofit sector. For instance, \"A Model of Christian Charity,\" by John Winthrop, elaborates a concept of communal interdependence that closely resembles the impetus of many contemporary faith- and community-based organizations. \"We must delight in each other, make others' conditions our own, rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together,\" writes Winthrop, \"always having before our eyes our commission and our community in the work, our community as members of the same body.\"\n\nThe Founding Fathers, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, are also well represented. For encouragement, read about Benjamin Franklin as he races around pre-Revolutionary Philadelphia organizing fire brigades, coordinating city clean-ups, and raising money for hospitals  the hard and rarely praised work of civil society. Similarly, Madison's contribution, Federalist No. 10, brilliantly explicates the competitive, pluralist dynamic that, Madison argued, should exist at every level of American government and society.\n\nSelections culled from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries range from original essays by Daniel Webster, John Marshall, and Alexis de Tocqueville (who observed in 1834 that \"In no country in the world has the principle of association been more successfully used or applied to a greater multitude of objects than in America\") to important scholarly works by W. E. B. DuBois and Kathleen McCarthy, and, taken together, deepen our understanding of the enduring theme of civil society in the United States.\n\nTo capture the scope and pace of changes in the nonprofit sector from the 1920s to the present day, Hammack selects readings about a range of topics, from community chests and community foundations, to private schools and nonprofit revenues. At the same time, items such as \"The Third Sector\" (1974), by the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, provide evidence for Hammack's contention that the field, in the second half of the twentieth century, became more professionalized and bureaucratized. The increased role of federal regulation and money is also covered in some depth.\n\nWhile Hammack may have erred on the side of comprehensiveness in focusing on the role of the federal government, the dream of individuals such as Jane Addams, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Billy Graham  none of whom is represented here  to create a more civil society remains a potent force.\n\nBy the end, every reader of this volume will be provoked to consider the nonprofit sector from a variety of fresh perspectives while, at the same time, discovering abundant inspiration in the words of those represented here. Moreover, most readers will agree that the making of the nonprofit sector in the United States has been a highly successful endeavor, and that Hammack's compilation performs a commendable service in documenting the story of that long and still-unfolding journey.\n\nSelections culled from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries range from essays by Daniel Webster, John Marshall, and Alexis de Tocqueville to important scholarly works by W. E. B. DuBois and Kathleen McCarthy, and, taken together, deepen our understanding of the enduring theme of civil society in the United States....",

        "title":"Going the Distance: The Case for Charitable Reform",
        "content":"Creating major congressional reform can seem like a marathon race. Fashioning and passing comprehensive reform is an arduous process in which patience and pacing succeed where sprinting fails. As we have seen in many past legislative struggles, the moral outrage and passion that spark many major legislative efforts often dissipate when political positioning, the short attention span of a fickle public, and electoral math outweigh the imperative for change that inspired the effort.\n\nThe charitable sector is now facing this kind of challenge to our endurance. Many in our community have been committed to effective and sensible charitable reform and giving incentives, currently contained in the Tax Relief Act of 2005 (aka the tax reconciliation bill). And we must remain so, particularly with recent promises by committee staff to remedy problematic provisions of the bill.\n\nFor those who reflexively oppose any legislative oversight, it is worth noting that the reforms included in the bill pale in comparison with the type of rash congressional overreaction that may spring from the next national news story detailing abuse within our sector. Measures could be introduced ad hoc, attached without context to other legislation, and give us a patchwork of damaging rules and regulations that in no way could be called reform. Such a piecemeal approach might include gaps that could render us vulnerable to exploitation by those whose intent is to enrich themselves.\n\nThe package of reforms in the tax reconciliation bill are a clear illustration of the ways we can prevent and penalize abuses in the future and, at the same time, avoid overbearing regulation. It was, after all, that goal that led us to where we are today.\n\nIn 2004, at the encouragement of the Senate Finance Committee, Independent Sectorconvened the Panel on the Nonprofit Sector, a broad effort undertaken by the charitable community to improve the transparency and accountability of charities and foundations and reduce the instances of abuse that were beginning to siphon some of the attention away from the good work our sector was doing to improve society.\n\nThe Panel and its working groups, consisting of leaders that reflect the diversity of the sector, collaborated with a broad spectrum of nonprofit leaders to examine the various aspects of governance and practice that had been flagged by the Internal Revenue Service and lawmakers as areas of potential abuse. We examined existing law and carved out a path to enlightened legislative reform that would allow us to work with government to fill the gaps we saw, to better enforce existing laws, and to encourage methods through which our sector might improve our own practices.\n\nThat path was paved by the more than 120 integrated recommendations for charitable organizations, government regulators, and the IRS that the Panel detailed in its Final Report. Designed to reduce abuse throughout the sector, these recommendations have become the roadmap for many of the charitable reforms included in the Senate's version of the tax reconciliation package currently being debated in a House-Senate conference. That version also contains a slate of tax incentives to spur increased charitable giving, increasingly vital provisions at a time when our organizations are being stretched financially in an unstable budgetary climate. Independent Sector, in tandem with many other charitable organizations, has been working closely with Congress to ensure the legislation that makes its way out of the conference is changed to reflect the values and needs of our ever-growing mosaic of charitable organizations.\n\nAnd that brings us back to the home stretch of this particular race.\n\nJust recently, the press reported that many of the reforms and incentives for which we have fought so steadfastly over the past year might not make it into the final reconciliation package. Those reports may be premature, fired off by a quick-trigger press.\n\nI know there are those in the sector who would look at a failed bill and declare victory. It is true that the Senate bill is not perfect. There are provisions we are currently working with Congress to eliminate or amend because they would hamper the ability of some charities and foundations to fulfill their charitable missions. And I understand the potential dangers of government overreaching that interferes with our work. But the reforms that are consistent with the Panel's recommendations were shaped by the ideas of leaders within our sector  and not merely by lawmakers who are removed from their real-world ramifications. The recommendations were propagated by balancing the pressing need for maintaining sector independence with providing meaningful government oversight  the two ideals behind any major charitable reform. And they were created with the most critical goal in mind: the overall long-term health of the sector.\n\nIn truth, real reform can only occur with our own proactive involvement. We are far better off encouraging Congress to reform our sector with our own passionate and reasoned voice at the center of the debate. And we must do so immediately, while the opportunity for real reform is upon us.\n\nDiana Aviv ispresident and CEO of Independent Sector, the Washington, D.C.-based leadership forum for charities, foundations, and corporate giving programs committed to advancing the common good in America and around the world. \n\nCreating major congressional reform can seem like a marathon race.

According to The European Union and the Right to Community Living (88 pages, PDF), EU regulations governing the use of structural funds must be interpreted consistently with the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities, which commits governments to ensuring that all people with disabilities can live in and receive the support needed to participate in society as equal citizens. In Central and Eastern Europe, however, where the bulk of these funds are allocated, a lack of clarity around their use, the absence of a monitoring mechanism, and misinterpretation of EU regulations have resulted in funds being invested in the modernization of long-stay institutions. The report recommends that regulations be rewritten to explicitly prohibit investments in the maintenance or extension of institutional care facilities and to permit existing housing to be purchased as homes for people with disabilities.",

It has done relatively little, however, to help train the police, fire, and public health departments that would be first responders in the event of future attacks. As part of its Homeland Security Project, the New York-based Century Foundation commissioned experts to examine preparedness efforts at the local level in Pennsylvania (52 pages, PDF), Texas (40 pages, PDF), Washington (36 pages, PDF), and Wisconsin (38 pages, PDF).

        "content":"In his article in the February 2011 issue of Alliance magazine, Atallah Kuttab described the wave of protests triggered by events in Tunisia that was sweeping across the Arab region as a \"Tunisami.\" At that point, only Tunisian ruler Zein Ben Ali had bowed to pressure for freedom and new opportunities in his country. Then Mubarak succumbed in Egypt, and other Arab rulers are either accepting reform or confronting demonstrators with brutal force.\n\nIt is still young people (between the ages of 15 and 24), representing more than a third of the total citizens of the Arab region, who continue to be at the eye of this Tunisami. (Libya is an exception: the use of arms by anti-government groups to defend their community against military attack by the Gaddafi-loyal Libyan army marginalized the masses, clearing all age groups, men and women, from the streets.) People are showing less and less fear, and since the beginning of March demonstrations have spread to almost all Arab countries with results that promise change towards a vibrant society. Indeed, in three months, since January, more has happened in the region than in the last fifty years.\n\nThe Changes: A Summary\n\nWhat changes have taken place since my previous article in early February? I have listed the countries according to intensity of recent events.\n\n\n\n\n\nTunisia: Zein AlAbdeen, president for more than twenty years, has left the country and his ruling party no longer exists.\n\n\n\nEgypt: President Hosni Mubarak, in command for thirty years, has resigned. He was banned from leaving the country and his wealth is under scrutiny.\n\n\n\nLibya: Amazing what a short time can do! Less than two months ago, I wrote: \"Moamar Qaddafi has been in power since 1969 and is lining up his family to inherit his rule. It's not clear what is brewing within the country.\" No longer. Demonstrations erupted and, instead of accepting the popular call for reform, Qaddafi used his army to quash the protests. We all know that the UN is working to provide military action to protect Libyan civilians. History suggests that Qaddafi's resorting to force  with its severe consequences for his country and its wealth  is simply postponing either his own fall or his acceptance of change.\n\n\n\nYemen: President Ali Abdallah Saleh lost many of his ministers, senior army officers, ambassadors, and local governors after his security forces brutally attacked demonstrators. The opposition is not satisfied with the compromises he made in February and demands he leave office. The split within the army will encourage popular demands for Saleh's resignation.\n\n\n\nSyria: President Bashar Assad is facing the first set of demonstrations for freedom in the south of the country (where the sweeping wave of the Tunisami has arrived). The only surprise is that these demonstrations did not happen much earlier. In Syria, no parties are tolerated and power has been passed from father to son. The Ba'ath ruling party dominates all aspects of life, and official corruption is rampant. Again, the regime has responded brutally, attacking demonstrators (the government claims ten dead, but other sources put the figure at over a hundred on one day alone  March 25). The mild concessions offered by the government of reviewing the emergency law,[1] in place since 1966, and increasing salaries for government employees are unlikely to placate popular opposition.\n\n\n\nPalestine: Demonstrators came out in force both in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip demanding the end of conflict between the two ruling parties, Hamas and Fateh. Peaceful demonstrations to achieve this objective continued in the West Bank, but in Gaza demonstrations came under attack by the security forces.\n\n\n\nBahrain: The use of force against demonstrations seems to have ended them for now. Unfortunately, the issues raised by the demonstrators were never dealt with, so we know protests will erupt again since Bahrain has a vibrant civil society and youth movement.\n\n\n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia: There were demonstrations in the eastern part of the country but, as in Bahrain, security forces dispersed them and there was even an edict or fatwa from the religious leaders and scholars outlawing protests as unIslamic. The government printed 1.5 million copies of this edict. The King has authorized a package of financial benefits  salary increases, bonuses, houses, etc.  which seems to have satisfied people for now.\n\n\n\nJordan: The prime minister, Bakhit, is pushing forward reforms, focusing especially on legislation relating to young people and eradicating corruption. Here demonstrations have been peaceful and supportive of what the government is doing, only demanding that it progresses with these reforms more quickly. The government has successfully eased pressure on the cost of living by freezing fuel prices.\n\n\n\nAlgeria: Public opinion has been mollified by President BouTafliqa's declaration of an end to the state of emergency, and provision of some financial benefits to citizens. Little has been heard since February.\n\n\n\nMorocco: The King of Morocco has introduced moves towards a constitutional monarchy and seems to be responding to people's wishes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, my interpretation of events is that there are three kinds of short-term results to be expected from the situation in the Arab region. First, changes leading to democracy; second, military clampdown with unpredictable results, varying from reform to maintenance of the oppressive status quo to splitting the country into a democratic and an autocratic state; and third, the offer of minor concessions by the regime to draw the sting of the popular movement, to buy time.\n\nWhat Lies Behind the Protests?\n\nIt is becoming clearer by the day that disregard for human rights and social injustice, treating people as subjects rather than citizens, and lack of governance lie behind all the ills in Arab societies, and the intention to change them is the unifying factor behind this popular movement. Each regime claims that it has learned from the experience of others. Mubarak said this of Tunisia before his downfall. The rulers of Libya and Yemen did too, but soon after their people were protesting on the streets. Syria went even further, permitting access to Facebook and Twitter, which were banned until this month. Whether because of that or not (Syrians were using proxies to get around the ban), within two weeks of the restriction being lifted, demonstrators were on the street asking for freedom. The more space rulers give to their people, the less the region's peoples will tolerate autocracy.\n\nAnother phenomenon that indicates regimes' lack of understanding of their constituency is that their main reforms focus on economic improvement. They have not accepted that citizens feel it is more important to be treated with dignity. They want to be able to hold their rulers accountable for the fair distribution of wealth and opportunities, and they want freedom.\n\nImplications for Civil Society Organizations and Philanthropy\n\nThis month, I read in the local section of the Jordan Times[2] that international businesses in a rich Gulf state have objected to donating $1 billion from their CSR funds to a white elephant health project set up by the wife of the ruler. They ran the risk of losing business in that country because they realized that their support could be construed as violating the Corrupt Practices Act in their own countries. They have also probably learned the lesson from Egypt and Tunisia that being close to the ruling family does not mean secure business. I hope that this is the shape of things to come  that CSR funds will stop finding their way into projects supported by rulers' spouses and family members, and will begin to be distributed in a transparent way to civil society organizations.\n\nGenerally, the philanthropic sector has been slow to react to what is happening. I am not aware of a discussion among civil society organizations in the region about the impact of the freedom thrust in the Arab region. A group of young people from various Arab countries, funded by individuals and not institutions, met in early April to reflect on their experiences and discuss the factors leading to the current movement, challenges that have arisen, and how to address them, and the role of CSOs in moving forward together. Similarly, the Arab Foundations Forum convened a meeting in Beirut in early May for its members to discuss their evolving role, followed up towards the end of May by a similar session at the European Foundation Center's annual meeting in Portugal.\n\nIt is refreshing to see growing interest in the region from many international foundations, especially from Europe and the United States, but their involvement will require local guidance. There is always the danger of imposing development on a region. As an example, there is a tendency for international organizations to look at employment creation without tackling the underlying issues related to social justice, citizens' rights, and ending corruption through good governance  thus falling into the same trap as the region's rulers by thinking that employment of youth is the solution. The young people in Egypt and Tunisia who were in the forefront of the protests were actually employed. Instead of donors acting alone and bringing ready-made solutions, therefore, I hope they will look for guidance from local peers and from local philanthropy advisory services.\n\nA New Arab Philanthropy\n\nFinally, I believe that Arabs are claiming back their place in history by being both inspired by, and inspiring to, other regions, and I hope that the use of the term 'Islamic philanthropy' will fade away. The term came about as a result of the infamous War on Terror. But the Arab region has its own philanthropic heritage influenced by Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n\nArabs have much in common with Muslim countries in South and South East Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia) and with countries in Europe (including Turkey). However, we also have our own uniqueness. I can foresee a time when, with increased confidence in an inspirational global role, Arabs will not feel the need to fend off stereotyping and Islamophobia. Arab philanthropy will not imply isolationism but will be exercised through collaboration with philanthropy in other regions. It will be coordinated through existing philanthropy infrastructure in the region such as the Arab Foundations Forum, research centers like the Gerhart Center for Philanthropy at the American University in Cairo, and philanthropy advisory services like SAANED for Philanthropy Advisory Services Arabia, operating from Jordan.\n\n1 The state of emergency, which has been imposed since 1966, means that the police can detain anybody for extended periods without stating the reason and without a court hearing. The government has promised to review this, not necessarily to remove it.\n\n2 Jordan Times, March 24, 2011, p. 4\n\nAtallah Kuttab is director general of the Welfare Association.

        "content":"What motivates us to give? The Perfect Gift: The Philanthropic Imagination in Poetry and Prose asks readers to ponder this question and many more. This anthology offers a tapestry of works that challenges each of us to think about the nature of generosity. The texts encourage reflection and rigorous introspection while acknowledging that there are no clear, definitive answers.\n\nDivided into five parts  \"Why Should I Give?\", \"How Should I Give?\", \"To Whom or for What Should I Give?\", \"What Should I Give?\", and \"Can Giving Be Taught?\" The Perfect Gift comprises Bible stories, commentary, short stories, essays, and poems from writers as varied as William Shakespeare, Aristotle, Dorothy Parker, O. Henry, and Edith Wharton. The strength of this work lies in the diversity of genres represented.\n\nThe Perfect Gift asks if you are emotionally prepared to be a charitable donor despite the potential for difficulty or awkwardness, and it stresses the need for extreme clarity about the very definition of \"helping.\" In \"Charitable Effort,\" for example, Jane Addams criticizes philanthropy based on the idea that \"only the 'worthy poor' are to be helped.\" Another challenge, according to Clifford Orwin's \"Princess Diana and Mother Teresa,\" is that charity is often delivered de haut en bas, or from top to bottom, a structure that \"affronts the dignity of the recipient and thereby our own egalitarianism.\"\n\nIf nothing else, this anthology forces you to examine your own opinions, ethics, and actions in the process of helping others. Although the majority of the works included reflect editor Amy A. Kass' background as a professor of the humanities, with a focus on classical literature and philosophy, she does manage to juxtapose the words of those you'd expect to find here, such as Alexis de Tocqueville and Andrew Carnegie, with a suitable selection of modern writers, among them Barry Schwartz and Clifford Orwin. But while the variety of eras represented by the writers adds to the texture of the collection, it would be enhanced even more by the inclusion of more women writers and writers of color. The absence of these voices inadvertently reinforces the idea that philanthropy is the sole province of the more culturally and economically privileged members of society.\n\nIn today's climate of cutbacks, layoffs, and world strife, it is refreshing to read a work that asks you to continue giving in the face of the many obstacles to charitable conduct. The Perfect Gift is not intended to provide answers to the questions presented in Kass' chapter titles; rather, its lesson is that it is incumbent upon each one of us to find those answers within ourselves and with one another.\n\nDivided into five parts  \"Why Should I Give?\", \"How Should I Give?\", \"To Whom or for What Should I Give?\", \"What Should I Give?\", and \"Can Giving Be Taught?\" The Perfect Gift includes Bible stories, commentary, short stories, essays, and poems....",

        "title":"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life",
        "content":"With financial markets worldwide teetering on the brink, it's worth noting that even as most investors their confidence shaken to the core  head for the doors, one man is still inside looking for bargains. Earlier this fall, as Wall Street seemed to crumble under the weight of trillions of dollars in risky derivatives bets, Warren Buffett invested $8 billion of his own money into Goldman Sachs, the storied Wall Street investment bank, and General Electric, the giant technology and financial services company, acting again on one of the principles that has made him the world's most successful investor: the key to investing is to find undervalued companies and invest in them for the long haul.\n\nIt's that kind of fearlessness and focus that has transformed a modest, plainspoken Nebraska boy into the Oracle of Omaha and a global cultural icon. From the investment community that hangs on his every word, to the ordinary American who sees his homespun Midwestern charm as a sign of honesty in a dishonest age, Buffett has become something of a rumpled colossus. And like the pronouncements delivered by his ancient Greek forerunner, Buffett's belief in the value of investing for the long term belies a far more complex understanding of human nature. Indeed, it is his keenly honed intuition and focused intelligence that has prompted so much to be written about him.\n\nEnter Alice Schroeder, whose new biography, The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, may be the only authorized examination of a man who describes himself as \"a not simple man with simple tastes.\" At more than 800 pages, the book is a sprawling mix of history, reminiscence, and anecdote. In it, we learn about Buffett's first job, as a paper boy, and about the many curios and keepsakes in his office (one of them a letter inviting him to invest in Long-Term Capital Management, a quant hedge fund that went belly up in 1998, causing Buffett to call it the best investment he never made). But even though Schroeder had unprecedented access to Buffett and his papers, the book is more chatty than it is analytical, and less critical than it is allegorical. As Schroeder would have it, Buffett's life has been like a snowball rolling downhill; given exactly the right conditions of snow and slope, a snowball inevitably will become bigger and roll faster. An apt metaphor for a man who during the depths of the last major recession in this country (1980-82) parlayed a personal fortune of $69 million into just under $1 billion and today has an estimated net worth of $54 billion, making him one of the richest men in the world.\n\nBuffett, of course, is equally famous for his 2006 announcement that he planned to give the bulk of his fortune (some $37 billion) to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. We learn from Schroeder that while Buffett had long anticipated dedicating a significant portion of his fortune to philanthropy, he never really concerned himself with how that money would be used once he was gone. Yes, he and his wife, Susie, had established the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation back in the 1960s. But while its funding interests were aligned with a variety of progressive causes  nuclear nonproliferation (a cause in which Buffet remains engaged through his support of Ted Turner's Nuclear Threat Initiative), overpopulation, and women's reproductive health and rights  the foundation's giving seldom exceeded half a million dollars annually, limited in large part by Buffett's insistence that wealth was for accumulating and not for throwing around. (As late as 2005 the foundation had only $500 million in assets.)\n\nAlas, Schroeder's account spends little time on Buffett's philanthropy, and those looking for the inside scoop on the decision to go all in with Bill and Melinda Gates are likely to be disappointed. But Schroeder, who spent years as an analyst at Morgan Stanley reporting on Buffett's every move as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has a keen understanding of the main character in her story, and woven into that narrative are bits and pieces that, when put together, reveal why and how Buffett came to his philanthropic epiphany.\n\nCertainly the death of his wife in 2004 prompted a sea change in Buffett's attitude toward his own wealth. Philanthropy had always been Susie Buffett's domain, and while Buffett himself had charitable interests, he never developed a plan of action as to how to allocate his wealth effectively. (Like many successful businessmen, he was more concerned with growing it.) Buffett had also always been cautious about giving his children a free ride on the Berkshire gravy train; wealth was to be earned, not lived off of, and Buffett was and, in many respects, remains  determined to avoid spoiling his children and grandchildren.\n\nBuffett's relationship with Bill Gates, one forged by an intense mutual appreciation, is another piece of the puzzle. While their relationship will no doubt be the subject of speculation for years to come they once traveled half way around world to sit on a boat on a river in China to play bridge together no moment in that relationship may be more telling than the 1995 gathering of Buffett's oldest friends and investors at the posh Kildare Club in Dublin, Ireland, which Gates attended as Buffett's guest.\n\nAs described by Schroeder, at one point during the evening Buffett handed out copies of Andrew Carnegie's famous essay \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" implored his guests to read it, and then prompted them to share their thoughts on what they planned to do with their own fortunes. The ideas that emerged ran the gamut from the expected (funding hospitals and university chairs) to the unexpected (one guest was actively giving away most of his money as quickly as he could make it). Then it was Gates' turn, and in short order the Microsoft co-founder laid out the basic premise that has informed much of his philanthropy since the mid-1990s: \"Shouldn't the measure of accomplishment be how many lives you can save with a given amount of money?\" For Gates, and soon for Buffett, philanthropy would be about giving while living to solve problems and save lives in the present.\n\nHowever noble an idea that might be, it still took Buffett more than a decade to figure out what to do with his vast fortune. That wealth  and Buffett's marriage to Astrid Menks, with whom he had been living since the late 1970s  as well as Bill Gates' decision to step down from his day-to-day responsibilities at Microsoft to devote himself full time to philanthropy, finally provided Buffett with his Carnegian moment. Indeed, his June 2006 announcement was anything but an impulsive act; for Buffett, it was the culmination of years of thinking about the best way to give it all away.\n\nBuffett knew he was good at making money  in fact, better than almost anybody else. It was a large part of the reason he had been able to convince his original investors to sign off on the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway in 1957. But giving money away was never his strength or a particular interest, and his wife's death made that even more apparent. So, Buffett did what any good investor would do: He found two people  Bill and Melinda  with the knowledge, skills, and passion for philanthropy to not only do it for him, but to do it better than he could ever hope to. According to Schroeder, the decision was not only unconventional, it was \"a gesture against philanthropic waste and grandiosity.\"\n\nStill, let us not forget, that however unexpected his gift to the Gates Foundation, or how generous he was in giving some $6 billion to his children's foundations, Warren Buffett remains one of the world's wealthiest individuals and, in some ways, a predictable guy. No sooner, for example, had he announced his gift to the Gates Foundation than he was flooded by thousands of requests from individuals for financial assistance. What to do? As Schroeder tells it, he packed up the whole lot and sent it to his sister along with a check for $5 million and instructions for her to sift through the requests and distribute the money as she saw fit.\n\nIt remains to be seen, of course, what Buffett will do next. He is still worth tens of billions of dollars, and he could live another decade or two, doing what he does best, which is making money. Certainly, that's his intention. But whatever he decides to do, people will be talking about Warren Buffett and the excellent adventure that has been his life for as long as people care about hard work, investing, and the American dream.\n\nFormer Morgan Stanley analyst Alice Schroeder examines, in exhaustive detail, the life and times of the world's most famous investor and perhaps its most selfless philanthropist....",

        "title":"The NGO Sector: Thoughts on Shifting the Mindset of Donors",
        "content":"I was introduced to charity at a young age. My parents encouraged my siblings and me to put aside a portion of our weekly allowance for those in need and to volunteer during summer vacations. Those experiences were solidified when I learnedhow charitable my grandfather, a surgeon, had been and by witnessing my parents' own selflessness and generosity. Their example had a profound effect on me and helped define my interest in helping other people.\n\nIn addition to my professional career, I have been actively involved as a volunteer with local charitable initiatives and in the field of international development for several years, during which time I've been exposed to both the good and bad of charity work.\n\nCharity, like most human activities, is not immune to corruption, ineptitude,or unprofessionalism. Traditionally understood to be virtuous deeds informed by compassion and empathy for the plight of those less fortunate, acts of charity are, at times, treated as little more than commodities in an ultra-competitive marketplace. The international \"NGO industry\" includes many players vying for ever-larger shares of the donor community's generosity, with some resorting to extreme measures. And the competition for limited financial resources is likely to intensify.\n\nAll of which begs the question: Should charities and nonprofits, many of which are working to address problems not of their own making, be held by donors to a higher  or different  standard? I don't know the answer. But I do think donors, and by extension the NGO sector, would be well served by considering the following:\n\n1. Lower administrative costs do not necessarily mean greater efficiency. I was once in a meeting with the executive director of an NGO who excused himself to take an important call. He later told me the call had been from a donor who wanted to give the organization $150,000, on one condition: that the entire amount be applied to the donor's favorite project without deductions for administrative fees. The executive director had argued (unsuccessfully) that it was virtually impossible to use the funds without the involvement of salaried staff and, further, that if every donor made the same request, no NGO would be able to function. The donor remained unmoved, and the organization eventually gave in to his demand.\n\nIt's not unusual for nonprofit organizations and NGOs to be asked to put every dollar donated to them into programming. Indeed, donors frequently, and incorrectly, assume that lower administrative costs are directly correlated to organizational efficiency. While nonprofit entities should definitely work to prevent waste of resources (including time), donors need to understand that administration and fundraising expenses can be an investment rather than a cost. Nonprofits unable to offer competitive salaries often are at a disadvantage in trying to attract the \"right\" candidates with an appropriate set of skills or, even worse, face the risk of losing staff they have invested resources in without getting a commensurate return.And as anyone in a leadership position knows, an organization's ability to hire and retain the right talent can be the difference between theefficient use of resources, a growing donor base, and better results overall and the opposite  organizational driftand a shrinking donor base.\n\n2. More commitment, less entitlement. Often after I've delivered a presentation that highlights the success of various humanitarian aid projects, I'll be approached by a crowd of motivated individuals eager to get involved. Many think the best way to do that is to start their own nonprofit organization or NGO. I know from experience that most of theseefforts will not pan out, and that's because people's ideas about development work are often divorced from reality. They fail to appreciate the fact that behind every idealized image of a desperate poor person receiving a large sack of rice or wheat with a grateful smile, a handful of people have devoted untold hours to clerical work and record keeping, report and proposal writing, meetings with potential partners, responding to donor requests, and, perhaps most challenging and important of all, fundraising.\n\nThe fact is, most people are unwilling to put in the long hours needed to make a difference, and that lack of commitment is often due to an elevated sense of entitlement. Many people interested in getting involved with or starting a nonprofit or NGO are fixated on titles and are unwilling to get their hands dirty with crucial tasks like fundraising. Similarly, too many people see fieldwork as an adventurous escapade  until they find themselves in a refugee camp situation confronted by logistical and linguistic challenges, sweltering heat, difficult terrain, lack of toilets and general hygiene, and the overwhelming misery of those in need. Smiles are rare among people who are suffering and desperate. Indeed, some of the faces and things I have witnessed over the years continue to haunt me late at night.\n\nMy advice? Don't get involved or start a nonprofit or NGO if you are unwilling to commit body and soul to the effort. No one will think less of you for deciding not to make such a commitment, which may not be the case if you go ahead and make promises you can't keep.\n\n3. Avoid power trips. Many donors fall into one of two categories: those who are both generous and unassuming, and those who are not. The former see their donations as a small part of a larger effort and appreciate the time and efforts of those involved in carrying out the work, whereas the latter too often equate giving with knowledge and espouse a patronizing attitude, not only toward the beneficiaries of their generosity but also toward the nonprofit or NGO doing the work.\n\nI have met far too many donors who fall into the latter category. Unfortunately, for those who are employed by a nonprofit, it can be a chore, or worse, to have to deal with a donor on a power trip. Making a donation to a nonprofit or NGO should be motivated by one's belief in the cause, not a desire to tellwell-intentioned people what they are doing wrong.\n\n4. Don't make it more difficult than it already is. Implementing an aid project, particularly one in a conflict zone or an area affected by a natural disaster, invariably poses avariety of challenges. There are the inevitable logistical problems and sociocultural issues as well as other difficult facts on the ground that are simply impossible to prepare for in advance. Given this reality, mistakes will happen.\n\nDonors have every right to know where their money is going, and I strongly believe in the value of transparency. But in striving for transparency, it is important to maintain a balance. Yes, mistakes must be acknowledged when they occur.Generally speaking, however, most of the people working in the NGO sector are committed to doing their best in difficult circumstances. When something does go wrong, donors should ask for details. If there is an identifiable performance gap, that may be an excellent opportunity for the donor to get involved and help the organization improve in that area. Otherwise, it's probably best not to make work more difficult for the organization than it already is.\n\nThe above suggestions are not meant to provide excuses for nonprofits and NGOs in the development space but rather to shed light on a subject that too often is painted with a broad brush. My experience as a volunteer for a diverse range of organizations has taught me that donors and the organizations they support almost always want the same thing. As in any relationship, however, open communication and good-faith efforts at understanding other perspectives are essential if the parties to the relationship are to forge a mutual trust. The key factors for both nonprofits/NGOs and donorsare a desire to improve their understanding of each other's needs, a willingness to commit to the relationship, and the grit to do the hard work necessary to make it better.\n\nShujaat Wasty, a practitioner in the international affairs and development field, is a member of the Leadership Council at the Institute for the Study of International Development at McGill University in Montreal.

        "title":"The Smartest Investment We Could Make: The Future of Girls",
        "content":"As the father of two young girls, there is no greater joy for me than to see them smile and thrive. This is why I often remember former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annans words: \"There is no policy for progress more effective than the empowerment of women and girls. A nation that neglects its children, especially girls, is a nation that neglects its future and development.\" Given this truth, the Parekh-Vora Charitable Foundation has initiated a focus on two areas particularly important to girls: water and sanitation, and primary school education.\n\nWe could have chosen many areas of need to focus on, so why girls, why water and sanitation, and why education?\n\nTo begin with, we were struck by the numbers: globally, 2.5 billion people live without basic sanitation, while 768 million people lack access to safe water. Every day, 2,000 children die from water-related diseases. And each year, 60 million children are born into homes without access to safe water and sanitation. It's estimated that improvements in these areas alone could vastly improve health outcomes, increase productivity, and reduce healthcare costs while increasing a country's gross domestic product (GDP) by anywhere from 2 percent to 7 percent. Girls are disproportionately affected by the water and sanitation crisis, given that they frequently miss school or drop out altogether because of a lack of a private toilet in school. Tens of thousands of other girls and women spend hours at a time walking for miles while carrying water on their heads that can weigh up to forty pounds. Simply put, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene enables women and girls to take control of their lives.\n\nThe numbers around education are equally alarming: 793 million people worldwide are illiterate. Once again, girls and women are disproportionately affected and account for two-thirds of all illiterate persons. In the developing world, an estimated 42 percent of girls are not enrolled in school, while more than 60 million primary school-aged children of both genders do not have access to education and likely will never learn to read or write. The numbers are confounding, not least because we know that even a few years of basic education empowers women and girls to take control of their lives. Educated women are healthier (an extra year of education for girls can reduce infant mortality by 5 percent to 10 percent) and earn more (an extra year of education boosts future wages by 20 percent). If every child were to receive an education, an estimated 171 million individuals would be lifted out of poverty.\n\nAs a foundation, we knew we wanted to fund initiatives that would have the greatest possible long-term impact for girls, and we knew we wanted to partner with nonprofit organizations that are making steady and significant progress in addressing these unfortunate statistics.\n\nOur research led us to WaterAid and Room to Read, two organizations that partner with local leaders, government, and nongovernmental organizations, and that take measurement and evaluation seriously, monitoring both short-term progress and the long-term sustainability of their efforts.\n\nOur research also led us to direct our gifts to regions and countries, such as India, where the need is greatest and our dollars will go the farthest. Through our partnership with WaterAid, the Parekh-Vora Charitable Foundation has proudly supported efforts to rehabilitate, repair, and test handpumps; support water, sanitation, and hygiene education in schools (particularly important for adolescent girls); and provide skills training so that local communities can better manage water, sanitation, and hygiene services.\n\nEqually rewarding from our perspective has been our support for Room to Read's Girls' Education program, which is designed to boost the number of years girls spend inschools and improve the girl-friendliness of school environments. We have also supported the creation of a new library at a government primary school in rural India, along with training for librarians and teachers.\n\nOur experience with these two organizations has been positive for several reasons. First, both WaterAid and Room to Read are deeply connected to the local communities in which they work. Second, both organizations take project monitoring and evaluation seriously, with excellent results. And third, both organizations provide regular updates from the field related to our financial contributions. In our minds, all three are essential for an investment in global development work to be effective, and we recommend that all donors think of them as critical prerequisites when selecting a nonprofit or nongovernmentalorganization with which to partner. As a father, I want all children to smile and thrive as my two girls do. By focusing on water and sanitation, and on primary school education, the Parekh-Vora Charitable Foundation hopes to do its small part in improving the lives of girls around the world.\n\nStill, when it comes to water, toilets, and education services for girls, more attention from foundations and donors is urgently needed. The challenges are great, and now more than ever we believe it is imperative for nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations to collaborate and share ideas, strategies, and resources. The more we collaborate, the greater the impact our shared investments will have on populations in need even as we reduce the amount lost to duplication and overlap. As Mahatma Gandhi said, \"We must be the change we want to see in this world.\n\n(The views expressed in thispost are Dr. Parekh's and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.)\n\nDr. Anand K.

        "title":"Losing the Red Cross Would Be the Real Disaster",
        "content":"As a disaster researcher and scholar of nonprofit management, I've followed the (well publicized) travails and (hardly publicized) successes of the American Red Crossover the years.\n\nI've met its national staff at research conferences and local staff at state and county emergency management meetings, where I've served on the board of my local Community Organizations Active in Disaster (COAD). I participated with hundreds of other invited experts in the governance audit that resulted in the \"American National Red Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007.\" Ive monitored the commentary after aProPublica/National Public Radioexpos of the Red Cross appeared last week. And based on my observations, I have developed a healthy respect and sympathy for the Red Cross.\n\nBet you didn't see that coming.\n\nThere's no disputing the fact that the public needs better results from the Red Cross. The organization has been essential to our welfare since the day it was chartered by Congress to be our national disaster response agency  primus inter pares among hundreds of agencies known collectively as voluntary organizations active in disaster. In fact, the Red Cross predates the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by seventy-nine years.\n\nCongress has entrusted a good part of disaster-related mass care and sheltering to the Red Cross. Somewhat less rationally, Congress imposed this public mandate on the Red Cross without much aid; the agency is expected to meet our nation's disaster relief needs largely through the philanthropic generosity of Americans.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the Red Cross has been plagued for years by leadership issues  issues that aren't easy to resolve because they are rooted in a number of larger, systemic problems:\n\nGreater forces of nature. Climate change makes it harder for all disaster relief agencies to achieve their mission. In the ProPublica/NPR story, a Red Cross executive observes the challenge of \"scaling up\" for Sandy, a storm that covered an area half the size of Europe. The organization's inability to do that was due to climate change, not internal organizational problems. In 2005, disaster relief agencies reached the same conclusion when they reported that the impact of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina was many times larger than their capacity to deal with back-to-back disasters. The lesson is clear: As disasters get larger and more complex, we all have to work together to scale our disaster response capacity.\n\nShortage of experienced staff. An increase in \"superstorms\" demands better frontline staff. However, internal reorganizations and massive layoffs triggered by a drop in donations have increased turnover and demoralized staff at the Red Cross. In my county last week, the national Red Cross laid off three of its four paid staff, including one of the state's most experienced disaster response professionals. That trend must be reversed. This is a unique and challenging profession. There are no easy substitutes. Disaster responders are trained to be flexible and resourceful because, as they often point out, every disaster is unique. Thus, disaster researchers and other observers note the challenge of getting it right every time. It takes training and experience, which depends, in turn, on stable, consistent funding to keep high-quality, experienced chapter staff (one of the Red Cross's most important assets) on the front lines.\n\nNational leaders at odds with grassroots base. The Red Cross traditionally has had a strong internal culture that fosters staff commitment (\"lifers\"). Any organization, whether for-profit or nonprofit, that finds itself at odds with its grassroots base is in trouble. There's no denying the impact on morale of the systemic leadership problems at the Red Cross, but they go much further back than the current CEO's tenure. Before Gail McGovern was hired, the Red Cross cycled through more than a half dozen CEOs and interim CEOs in as many years. Friction between national and chapter staff isn't new, and it's clear that, to some degree, the organization's national leadership has been in denial about it. The solution is for the national board to recognize its responsibility to improve the organization's culture and to invest in the base. The board began that process with a governance restructuring six years ago and has followed up with a healthy investment in inter-organizational collaboration and public transparency initiatives. The tone is changing, and I am encouraged by that fact. But more needs to be done.\n\nShirking our collective responsibility to be prepared. Unfortunately, public criticism of the Red Cross has not been accompanied by an equally vigorous public discussion of our responsibility as citizens to prepare ourselves in advance. Ask any emergency responder what he or she wants from us, and you'll get the same answer: \"Make a plan and assemble a kit. We can help you best when you help yourself.\" One of the most active Red Cross campaigns is about family and workplace emergency preparedness (see also FEMA's excellent resources at www.ready.gov).\n\nI'm a scholar but also a citizen. From a rational point of view, the most dangerous outcome of the ProPublica/NPR story would be a second \"disaster\" in the form of an escalating public mistrust of the Red Cross, resulting in fewer donations and an even weaker paid and volunteer force that is demoralized by the public's lack of understanding about the good work they do every day. Increased turnover will worsen the kind of staffing issues the organization faces. More political and media scrutiny is likely to result in more, not less, questionable decision making at the top (e.g., diverting assets for public relations junkets).\n\nSo what can we do? First, get yourself prepared. Second, be generous. This is not the time to withdraw support from the Red Cross. The organization operates like an army but on exponentially less funding. McGovern runs a $3.5 billion enterprise on a fraction of the salary of a college football coach. And she does it with largely volunteer (albeit well-trained) labor. Disaster agency budgets go through \"feast\" or \"famine\" periods. Try holding on to a good workforce when faced with that kind of budget uncertainty. An operation with twenty-nine thousand staff and four hundred thousand volunteers needs stable funding if its job is to deploy anywhere in the United States after any disaster and help any citizen, regardless of age, disability, creed, or race, who needs it.\n\nLocal Red Cross employees are not only highly respected, they are some of the hardest-working people I know. Sit in an emergency planning meeting with them in any local community, and they will have their phones/radios on, ready to leave for a house fire, flood, ice storm, or tornado on a moments notice. Some day that house might be yours.\n\nThe Red Cross should be held accountable for problems of its own making. We should hold ourselves accountable for the rest.\n\nBeth Gazley is an associate professor of public affairs and philanthropic studies at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Public and Environmental Affairs.\n\nAs a disaster researcher and scholar of nonprofit management, I've followed the (well-publicized) travails and (hardly publicized) successes of the American Red Crossover the years....",

        "title":"The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector",
        "content":"Nonprofit brands are visible everywhere. Amnesty International, Habitat for Humanity, and World Wildlife Fund are some of the most widely recognized brands in the world, more trusted by the public than the best-known for-profit brands. Large nonprofits such as the American Cancer Society and the American Red Cross have detailed policies to manage the use of their names and logos, and even small nonprofits frequently experiment with putting their names on coffee cups, pens, and T-shirts.\n\nBranding in the nonprofit sector appears to be at an inflection point in its development. Although many nonprofits continue to take a narrow approach to brand management  using it as a tool for fundraising  a growing number are moving beyond that approach to explore the wider strategic roles that brands can play: driving broad long-term social goals while strengthening internal identity, cohesion, and capacity.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, recently appointed Tom Scott as director of global brand and innovation. Oxfam International embarked on a confederation-wide \"global identity project.\" And GBCHealth was one of several organizations completing a rebranding process. Brand managers in these pioneering organizations were focusing less on revenue generation and more on social impact and organizational cohesion. Indeed, some of the most interesting brand strategies are being developed in endowed, private foundations with no fundraising targets at all.\n\n\"We're catalysts,\" says Scott. \"Could we have greater impact if we leveraged our brand in different ways? What difference could it make to attach our logo to things to move conversations forward or elevate certain issues? Can we use our brand to elevate other brands?\" The questions Scott asks aren't about raising money. Instead, they are about how to leverage the Gates Foundation brand in the cause of greater public discourse and social impact.\n\nAlthough the ambitions of nonprofit brand managers are growing, the strategic frameworks and management tools available to them have not kept up. The models and terminology used in the nonprofit sector to understand brand remain those imported from the for-profit sector to boost name recognition and raise revenue.\n\nNonprofit leaders need new models that allow their brands to contribute to sustaining their social impact, serving their mission, and staying true to their organization's values and culture. In this article, we describe a conceptual framework designed to help nonprofit organizations do just that. We call this framework the Nonprofit Brand IDEA (in which \"IDEA\" stands for brand integrity, brand democracy, brand ethics, and brand affinity).\n\nThe framework is the result of an eighteen-month research project we led with colleagues at Harvard University's Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations and collaborators at the Rockefeller Foundation. Building on previous work in the field, we conducted structured interviews with seventy-three nonprofit executives, communication directors, consultants, and donors in forty-one organizations. Then we analyzed these interviews to learn how leaders in the field are thinking about nonprofit brands today and how they see the role of brands evolving.\n\nThe Nonprofit Brand IDEA emerged from the distinctive sources of pride that nonprofit leaders expressed in what they do  pride in the social mission, participatory processes, shared values, and key partnerships  and from the distinctive role that they said brand plays to create greater cohesion inside their organizations. We developed this framework to capture the most striking things we heard in our interviews, but we've found that it also gives nonprofit leaders a vocabulary with which to manage in the new brand paradigm. Before we explain the framework in more detail, it is important to be clear about what we mean by brand and how the use of brand is evolving.\n\nRole of Brands\n\nA decade ago, the dominant brand paradigm in the nonprofit sector focused on communications. Nonprofit executives believed that increased visibility, favorable positioning in relation to competitors, and recognition among target audiences would translate into fundraising success. Branding was a tool for managing the external perceptions of an organization, a subject for the communications, fundraising, and marketing departments.\n\nIn contrast, the emerging paradigm sees brand as having a broader and more strategic role in an organization's core performance, as well as having an internal role in expressing an organization's purposes, methods, and values. Increasingly, branding is a matter for the entire nonprofit executive team. At every step in an organization's strategy and at each juncture in its theory of change, a strong brand is seen increasingly as critical in helping to build operational capacity, galvanize support, and maintain focus on the social mission.\n\nBy now it should be clear that we are defining brand quite broadly. A brand is more than a visual identity: the name, logo, and graphic design used by an organization. A brand is a psychological construct held in the minds of all those aware of the branded product, person, organization, or movement. Brand management is the work of managing these psychological associations. In the for-profit world, marketing professionals talk of creating \"a total brand experience.\" In the nonprofit world, executives talk more about their \"global identity\" and the \"what and why\" of their organizations. But the point in both cases is to take branding far beyond the logo.\n\nWhen we asked leading nonprofit practitioners, management scholars, and nonprofit brand consultants what a brand is, the responses were not any different from what those in other sectors might say. Some described brand as an intangible asset and a promise that conveys who you are, what you do, and why that matters. Others felt that a brand captures the persona of an organization and represents its very soul or essence. Yet others identified brand in terms of not only what is projected but also what is perceived. Last, brand was seen as a source of efficiency because it acts as a time-saving device, providing a shortcut in the decision making of potential investors, customers, clients, and partners.\n\nWhen we asked what a strong brand can bring to an organization, the similarity across sectors was again apparent. Peter Walker, director of the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University, speaks for many of his peers when he says, \"A strong brand allows you to acquire more resources and gives you the authority to have more freedom over how you use them.\" Strong brands in all sectors help organizations acquire financial, human, and social resources, and build key partnerships. The trust that strong brands elicit also provides organizations with the authority and credibility to deploy those resources more efficiently and flexibly than can organizations with weaker brands.\n\nIt should be no surprise that nonprofit executives define brand in for-profit language. Business language is spreading in part because it is proving useful to nonprofit executives in communicating with board members and donors whose own roots are in the for-profit world, and because many of the people managing brands in the nonprofit sector have themselves come from for-profit businesses. Indeed, we were struck to find that the majority of the nonprofit brand managers we interviewed during our research had worked first in the commercial world.\n\nEven with this convergence between the nonprofit and for-profit sectors, the nonprofit brand managers we interviewed said that brands do play distinctive roles in the nonprofit sector. These differences relate to the role of brand in driving broad long-term social goals, the role of brand inside nonprofit organizations, and the multiplicity of audiences that nonprofits must address. These differences may come down to questions of emphasis and focus, as brands in the for-profit world also contribute to long-term business purposes, play internal roles, and speak to multiple audiences. Still, we believe the greater weight given to these roles in the nonprofit sector is fundamental, rooted in the fact that each nonprofit advances a multiplicity of value propositions, irreducible to a single monetary metric, most of which can be advanced only if the other organizations in its field also succeed.\n\n\"Brand becomes critical when you're seeking to create partnerships, when you're seeking other funders, and when you're looking to associate yourself with people in the field,\" explains Diane Fusilli, a global brand consultant and former communications director at the Rockefeller Foundation. \"A strong brand helps bring greater credibility and trust to a project quicker, and acts as a catalyst for people to want to come to the table.\"\n\nEngaging Brand Skeptics\n\nThe Nonprofit Brand IDEA is based on two themes that we discovered during our research: the distinctive sources of pride that nonprofit leaders have in their organizations, and the distinctive roles that brand plays inside these organizations to create cohesion and build capacity. We turn first to the sources of pride.\n\nInterestingly enough, the way that we identified the sources of pride was by first listening to nonprofit leaders express their skepticism about the role of branding in the nonprofit sector. It turns out that the old brand paradigm has produced a deep current of skepticism about branding within nonprofit organizations, making many nonprofit leaders ambivalent about both the concept of brand and the terminology of branding. Although some branding professionals urge nonprofit leaders to push past this skepticism, we believe the skepticism suggests how nonprofit brands might be managed differently from their for-profit counterparts. Our interviews surfaced at least four legitimate sources of skepticism.\n\nFirst, many nonprofit leaders still widely associate branding withthe commercial pursuit of monetary gain. Brand skeptics think of the premium prices that for-profit firms charge for brand-name products and worry that this elevation of brand over substance will debase their work. They worry that the names of their organizations will be inflated beyond what the quality of their work alone would support, as the pursuit of revenue becomes a goal in its own right. They also worry that their organizations will be \"selling ideas the way you sell cereal,\" as Mahnaz Afkhami of the Women's Learning Partnership for Rights, Development, and Peace puts it. Scholars studying nonprofit branding similarly worry about the \"overcommercialization of the [nonprofit] sector and misappropriation of techniques developed specifically for the commercial environment.\"\n\nThe second source of skepticism is that brand management is sometimes seen as a top-down shortcut to avoid a participatory strategic planning process  an effort by top management to impose greater conformity in goals and priorities. Indeed, many people we interviewed drew contrasts between rebranding efforts and strategic planning. Because rebranding is usually staffed differently and organized with less participation than strategic planning, the new brand can feel peremptorily imposed from above. These concerns can be especially great when a new leader initiates a rebranding as part of an aggressive effort to change the way an organization works.\n\nThird, brand skeptics sometimes worry that a focus on branding is grounded in the vanity of an organization's leadership rather than the needs of the organization. \"I've seen situations in foundations where the brand, the reputation, has become an end in itself, or just too personal to the leadership, rather than a tool for fulfilling the mission,\" says Katherine Fulton, president of the Monitor Institute. We also found a broader concern that branding was sometimes driven by values that are antithetical to the organization. \"Campaigns like 'save a slave' seem to exploit suffering or marginalization to grab people's attention,\" says Afkhami. Beneath both these examples lies distrust of the value that is motivating what might be an otherwise well-intended branding effort.\n\nThe fourth concern skeptics have, particularly in organizations that work regularly in coalitions and collaborations, is that one organization's powerful brand will overshadow weaker brands, reinforcing, rather than correcting, imbalances of power among partners. When large nonprofits insist that joint activities conform to their idea of quality, brand management by the larger organization can feel to the weaker organization like bullying, and these bully brands give brand management a bad reputation. As Ramesh Singh, former chief executive of ActionAid and now director of learning, monitoring and evaluation at the Open Society Foundations, notes: \"There's a tension between bigger brands and smaller brands. The bigger international NGOs and philanthropies can (sometimes) push their own brand more, to the detriment of other organizations that can become invisible, and it's always resented.\"\n\nViewed more positively, each of these four strands of skepticism reveals a corresponding source of pride in the nonprofit sector: pride in the mission of an organization, pride in participatory planning, pride in the values that define organizational culture, and pride in supportive partnerships. The Nonprofit Brand IDEA builds on these four sources of pride, as well as on the distinctive role that brand plays in the nonprofit sector, to which we now turn.\n\nBrands Bring Cohesion and Capacity\n\nJust as the brand skeptics led us to the four sources of pride, the brand enthusiasts we interviewed focused our attention on the important role that brand plays inside nonprofits to create organizational cohesion and build capacity.\n\nMany of our interviewees felt that a brand plays different roles with different audiences. Internally, the brand embodies the identity of the organization, encapsulating its mission, values, and distinctive activities. Pip Emery, who co-led the most recent global identity project at Amnesty International, puts it this way: \"If you don't know where you're going and why you're relevant, you don't have a brand.\" Externally, the brand reflects the image held in the minds of the organization's multiple stakeholders, not just its donors and supporters but also those it seeks to influence, assist, or reach.\n\nA nonprofit brand is most powerful when the organization's internal identity and external image are aligned with each other and with its values and mission. As brand consultant Will Novy-Hildesley describes it, \"Brand is an exquisite bridge between program strategy and external communications.\" Indeed, it is often a misalignment between internal identity and external image that is the impetus for rebranding efforts in nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe result of alignment in mission, values, identity, and image is a clear brand positioning and increased cohesion among diverse internal constituencies. When an organization's employees and volunteers all embrace a common brand identity, it creates organizational cohesion, concentrates focus, and reinforces shared values. As Marcia Marsh, chief operating officer of the World Wildlife Fund in the United States puts it: \"Our brand is the single greatest asset that our network has, and it's what keeps everyone together.\" The result of this alignment and clarity in positioning is greater trust between the nonprofit and its partners, beneficiaries, participants, and donors. Because nonprofit organizations rely on establishing trust with many external audiences, doing what you say you do and being who you say you are is crucial.\n\nStrong cohesion and high levels of trust contribute to greater organizational capacity and social impact. A cohesive organization is able to make more efficient and focused use of existing resources, and high external trust attracts additional talent, financing, and authority. This increase in organizational capacity enhances an organization's social impact. By leveraging the trust of partners, beneficiaries, and policymakers, an organization can make greater strides toward achieving its mission. On the flip side, those organizations that face challenges in terms of internal organizational coherence, or the erosion of trust held by external constituencies (either because of scandals or misperceptions), struggle to build organizational capacity and impact.\n\nThe role of brand within nonprofit organizations is therefore cyclical and can be captured in a model we call the Role of Brand Cycle. In this model, brand is nested within organizational strategy, which in turn is nested within the mission and values of the organization. Brand plays a variety of roles that, when performed well, link together in a virtuous cycle. A well-aligned identity and image position the organization to build internal cohesion and trust with external constituents. Organizations can leverage these to strengthen internal capacity and achieve impact in the world. The resulting reputation then enhances the identity and image of the brand with which the cycle began.\n\nThe Nonprofit Brand Idea\n\nHaving explained the distinctive sources of pride that nonprofit leaders have in their organizations, and the important role that brand plays in building organizational cohesion, we turn now to explaining the Nonprofit Brand IDEA framework. The four principles of Nonprofit Brand IDEA are brand integrity, democracy, ethics, and affinity.\n\nBrand integrity means that the organization's internal identity is aligned with its external image and that both are aligned with the mission. We use the word integrity to mean structural integrity, not moral integrity. Internally, a brand with high structural integrity connects the mission to the identity of the organization, giving members, staff, volunteers, and trustees a common sense of why the organization does what it does and why it matters in the world. Externally, a brand with high structural integrity captures the mission in its public image and deploys that image in service of its mission at every step of a clearly articulated strategy. Singh talks about brand identity and image as \"two sides of the coin\" and explains that in his experience, their alignment \"allows us to focus, to be brave...to speak out.\" At ActionAid, he says, brand integrity allowed the organization to create relationships with people in the peasant movement \"without which we wouldn't have been able to work.\"\n\nBrand democracy means that the organization trusts its members, staff, participants, and volunteers to communicate their own understanding of the organization's core identity. Brand democracy largely eliminates the need to tightly control how the brand is presented and portrayed. The appetite for brand democracy among nonprofit leaders is largely a response to the growth of social media, which has made policing the brand nearly impossible. Alexis Ettinger, head of strategy and marketing at the University of Oxford's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, puts it bluntly: \"Given the rise of social media, it would be insane to try to single-handedly control the brand.\"\n\nBrand ethics means that the brand itself and the way it is deployed reflect the core values of the organization. Just as brand integrity aligns the brand with mission, brand ethics aligns both the organization's internal identity and its external image with its values and culture. This is about more than being known as an ethical organization, but extends to the organization's use of its brand in ways that convey its values. We heard many stories of lapses in brand ethics, such as using pitiful photographs of an organization's beneficiaries to motivate donors. Yasmina Zaidman, communication director at Acumen Fund, contrasts these exploitive images with Acumen's tagline \"Seeing a world beyond poverty.\" Acumen avoids \"images of poverty that...dehumanize the people whom we want to actually help,\" she says, instead promoting images of \"pride and dignity.\"\n\nBrand affinity means that the brand is a good team player, working well alongside other brands, sharing space and credit generously, and promoting collective over individual interests. An organization with strong brand affinity attracts partners and collaborators because it lends value to the partnerships without exploiting them. \"We came to view ourselves not as being the leader, but as a partner of choice,\" explains Peter Bell, former CEO of CARE. Organizations with the highest brand affinity promote the brands of their partners as much as or more than they promote their own brands, redressing rather than exploiting the power imbalances that inevitably exist in any partnership or collaboration.\n\nPutting Idea to Work\n\nIn the section that follows, we explore ways that nonprofit leaders can use the four principles not only to enhance their brand, but to improve the effectiveness of their entire organization as well.\n\nNowhere is the practical value of brand integrity more evident than in the relationship of brand to an organization's theory of change. At WWF, for example, part of the theory of change depends on the organization's ability to persuade some of the biggest multinational corporations to enter into partnerships that lead the companies to change their business practices. WWF's strong global brand is crucial to its ability to establish these partnerships. \"You're big, we're big, so we understand each other,\" as Emily Kelton, director of corporate relations at WWF US, puts it. Having a strong brand establishes a kind of parity between WWF and the companies they want to influence. By starting with a theory of change, and looking for the contribution that brand can make at each step, it keeps the brand tightly aligned with mission and strategy.\n\nBrand democracy requires a fundamental shift in the traditional approach to brand management. Organizations aspiring to brand democracy do not police their brands, trying to suppress unauthorized graphics and other representations of the organization, but strive instead to implement a participatory form of brand management. They provide resources, such as sample text and online templates, that all staff can access and adapt to communicate the mission, strategy, work, and values of the organization. As part of an effort to strengthen the brand at WWF US, for example, what began as an internal competition among staff to craft a single \"elevator speech\" revealed the greater power of personal statements over uniform corporate slogans. Instead of picking one winner, they selected three entries as samples to encourage everyone to personalize the brand. \"One single company line doesn't work,\" says Kerry Zobor, vice president of institutional communications at WWF US. \"It just doesn't ring true.\"\n\nFor brand democracy to produce a consistent image, however, requires strong organizational cohesion supported by a strong internal brand identity. Brand democracy is not brand anarchy. Organizations need to establish parameters for a brand, even if the space within these limits is large. Rachel Hayes, senior director of communications and community engagement at Oxfam America, describes this as \"creating bookends.\" \"These are the boundaries of our brand. And within those boundaries, each affiliate will have the ability to dial up and dial down certain messages to meet their local market, but they will be unified in overall look, in overall voice, and in graphic standards so that we do convey one brand.\"\n\nEmbracing brand democracy leads to the need to manage brand ethics. The risk here is not brand anarchy, but rather any individual expression of the brand that offends or contradicts organizational values or culture. Traditional values statements seem inadequate to this task, for the values made explicit in such statements tend to be at a high level of abstraction. The brand images that cause concern for brand ethics often are themselves the catalyst for making tacitly held values explicit. For example, when one chapter of Amnesty International developed a video game designed to engage young people in the movement to abolish the death penalty, others in the organization became uncomfortable. There was nothing about the game that deviated from the mission, but some people thought making a game out of something deadly serious violated organizational values. The organization's value statements provided a starting point for serious debate about how the game would shape Amnesty's image. The result was a robust discussion in which the chapter leaders convinced others of the value of the game, so that it was retained.\n\nThe practical implications of a commitment to brand affinity are especially clear in coalitions, where multiple organizations join in a common cause that has its own image and identity. Nonprofit leaders in such coalitions often worry that the collective identity will overshadow their own brand, and we heard stories of coalitions  such as the Make Poverty History campaign  that collapsed because of this concern. The TckTckTck campaign, in contrast, deliberately allowed the brands of individual members to remain prominent. In this coalition, each organization retained its own identity and logo, which Christian Teriete, communications director for the Global Campaign for Climate Action, describes as a flotilla of ships with distinct brand flags. \"Everybody [has] this little additional flag on the top mast that [has] the [coalition identity]. So, in a way, we are all different groups, but we are all united.\"\n\nFurther Implications\n\nIn addition to providing a framework for nonprofit managers and organizational strategists to better manage their brands, the Nonprofit Brand IDEA may also prove useful in managing other tasks, such as board governance, global operations, and risk management.\n\nThe emerging brand paradigm suggests a new role for directors and trustees of nonprofit organizations in the governance of brand. Rather than asking how brand management is contributing to revenue, boards (like managers) are beginning to ask how the brand is aligned with the mission, values, and strategy of the organization. They are asking about the alignment of image and identity, and they are asking about the contribution of brand to internal cohesion as well as to external trust. Perhaps most important, boards are asking about the role of the brand in enhancing operational capacity and driving social impact. Boards looking for metrics of effectiveness of brand management might measure increases in commitment and pride among staff and directors, and those conducting qualitative evaluations might probe for signs that mission drift has been reduced and that choices about which projects, resources, and partnerships to pursue have been easier to make. A strong brand should increase both the speed and the breadth of consensus decisions in governing bodies.\n\nBrand management is especially challenging for organizations working globally. Because language and symbols vary from country to country, equating brand with specific words or images can be perilous for global organizations. These organizations will find it particularly important to build their brands around mission, values, and strategy, leaving it to the local affiliates operating in particular countries or cultures to represent these ideas in their own way.\n\nAn organization with a low profile and very little reputation may be willing to take great risks, but once the organization has established a trusted brand it may be hesitant to pursue projects that could put the brand at risk. We explored this issue in our interviews and were impressed at how often the inevitability of this dynamic was rejected. Nonprofit leaders acknowledged that there can be tension between brand protection and the risks inherent in innovation or advocacy, but these are tensions that good management should be able to handle. Indeed, it appears that high brand integrity may, by strengthening internal cohesion and trust among partners, enable an organization to do more, which may translate into a greater willingness to experiment, take risks, and drive innovation.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect nonprofit executives, boards, and staff to become increasingly confident about managing their brands in distinctive and powerful ways. Just as the specification of theories of change has given nonprofit strategy a distinctive feel, brand integrity, democracy, ethics, and affinity can help distinguish brand management in the nonprofit sector.\n\nThe authors are grateful to their collaborators at Harvard University's Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Sherine Jayawickrama, Johanna Chao Kreilick, and Alexandra Pittman, and to Zia Khan, Melvin Galloway, and Claudia Juech at the Rockefeller Foundation, who shaped and supported this research.\n\nIn the latest article in our SSIR series, the researchers of a recent study on nonprofit branding share details of how the sector is pushing beyond the boundaries of brand as fundraising tool into a broader and more strategic approach designed to create greater social impact and tighter organizational cohesion....",

        "title":"Curtains? The Future of the Arts in America",
        "content":"The arts  as we know it  are doomed. The broad cultural and economic consensus of the last century that placed paramount value on the arts, arts education, and art institutions has been lost like the voice of Yeats' falconer in the widening gyre. Tomorrow we will have less art, and we will be the poorer for it.\n\nLike an Old Testament prophet, Michael M. Kaiser, the former president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, warns of a fundamental crisis in the arts: the way they are created, managed, and marketed in America is simply not sustainable. Ironically, as recently as 2013, Kaiser, in The Cycle: A Practical Approach to Managing Arts Organizations, was somewhat optimisticthat such a worst-case scenario could be averted, and he outlined a series of steps arts organizations could take to fortify themselves for the tough times ahead.\n\nNot so much in 2015. In his new book, Curtains? The Future of the Arts in America (Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2015), Kaiser paints a dark picture of the future, both explaining how things came to pass and what arts organizations, especially mid-sized ones, might do to (maybe) save themselves from oblivion.\n\nHis argument goes like this: In economic terms, the arts are playing a losing hand; in almost every other industry, the costs of production are reduced over time, allowing for more goods to be sold at a lower price point. Innovation and commodification contribute to this process, enabling goods to be produced ever-more cheaply and distributed on a vast scale, which in turn allows for the increasing segmentation of consumer markets and real-time adaptation to changing tastes and expectations. Alas, almost none of this is true for the arts.\n\nThe performing arts in particular, writes Kaiser, are a labor-intensive endeavor in which every unit (i.e., performance) is numbingly expensive to produce  a cost that is passed on to members of the audience in the form of ever-rising ticket prices. Moreover, when every performance must support a portion of the salaries and pensions of hundreds of performers, managers, and back-office staff, as well as theater maintenance and the marketing of the production and institution itself, it's little wonder that arts professionals look to the future with pessimism and deep anxiety.\n\nIt wasn't always this way. A half-century ago, with the U.S. economy booming, government coffers bursting, and the costs of sustaining arts institutions much less daunting, the arts in America entered a sort of golden age. Arts education increasingly was viewed as a social good to be sustained with taxpayer dollars, and children, as they grew older, followed their parents' lead and became arts consumers and patrons in their own right. While twentieth-century forms of entertainment such as movies, television, and pop music all competed with live performances of more traditional art forms for audience dollars and attention, they served, more than anything else, to fuel Americans' interest in and a broader engagement with the arts. In particular, visionary investments like those made by the Ford Foundation in developing networks of regional theaters enabled the performing arts to flourish in cities large and small, while Lucille Lortel made Off-Broadway a household name.\n\nBut the good times couldn't last forever, and they didn't, undone by a combination of rising costs, stagnating household incomes, and ferocious competition from cheaper digital alternatives. Kaiser's lens is both economic and cultural, and he has a lot to say about the need for arts organizations to change  in a hurry. But his book isn't political, and readers will find little in the way of policy prescriptions or legislative recommendations. Indeed, Kaiser takes the position that the days of significant and sustained government support are over. Support for the arts as a percentage of federal and state spending, he notes, has been falling since the 1980s, while a perfect economic storm has emboldened two generations of anti-tax budget-cutters, resulting in an increasingly hostile climate with respect to public funding for the arts.\n\nDitto arts education. Kaiser finds it disturbing, if not unfathomable, that an entire generation has now reached adulthood without the benefit of any meaningful arts education or an appreciation of the arts' role in the life of a well-rounded person and the nation. What's more, the aging of a generation of loyal theatergoers and arts patrons raises for many organizations a deeply troubling question: Who will replace them when they are no longer there to support us? Efforts to cultivate a new generation of arts consumers and donors are not working, writes Kaiser. Twenty- and thirty-something millennials have a seemingly endless array of entertainment choices to choose from, and the cost of those choices is falling as rapidly as their number is exploding. At the bottom of the list for most millennials are expensive live performances of traditional art forms with which they have never seriously engaged. Why, as Kaiser puts it, spend $600 on a ticket to the Metropolitan Opera when you can hop over to YouTube and watch, at no charge, a video of the same performance  or anything else, for that matter  any time you feel like it? Exacerbating the situation is the fact that most arts organizations simply don't have the resources to cultivate relationships with semi-engaged (at best) millennials who may (or may not) be there for them two or three decades down the road.\n\nNor does Kaiser let foundations  in the past, a critical source of support  off the hook. His too-brief look at how they are responding to the shifting sands he describes elsewhere in the book is less than complimentary. According to Kaiser, too many foundations, thinking they are being innovative and far-sighted, are shifting their support for the arts to endowments (which, he notes, have the attraction of a supposedly guaranteed income stream), while at the same time making things more difficult for arts organizations by scaling back on or refusing to provide general operating support. Similarly, he isn't impressed by what he sees as a growing trend among arts organizations to pursue big donors and gifts, even as they neglect to cultivate more modest donations; yes, a $100 million gift is better than a stick in the eye, but what do institutions lose when they neglect hard-won relationships with the tens of thousands of regular patrons who have supported them over the decades? The absence of real and sustained engagement with those audiences, combined with a general unwillingness to embrace new technologies, casts further doubt on the long-term sustainability of many, if not most arts organizations.\n\nIn short, it's all a mess, and while Kaiser thinks he can be of some help, he doubts whether he, or anyone else, can actually fix the problems of the arts in America. As he argued in his earlier work, he strongly believes that for any arts organization to survive into the middle of this century, it will have to get real about creating great art, marketing it relentlessly (Hollywood-style, if need be), building a strong and committed board, and being much more sophisticated about fundraising and merchandising. Of course, all that requires talent and an enormous amount of money, and where those resources are going to come from is anything but clear.\n\nWhat is clear is that larger arts organizations, in most cases, have the resources and capacity to follow his advice and are positioned to attract, by virtue of their reputations and brands, talented managers, loyal audiences, and deep-pocketed donors. What's more, some, like the Metropolitan Opera, which, with tickets priced at $25 a pop, has been packing movie theaters across the country with people eager to see extremely well-crafted live broadcasts of its performances, will show themselves to be truly innovative. Indeed, according to Kaiser, the Met and other institutions need to do more of that kind of thing, perhaps taking a page from professional sports; why not make a live performance of La Bohme as cool as Monday Night Football? That might not be good for the mid-sized opera company in a place like, say, Nashville, but then again the competition might be just what the doctor ordered if it helps to elevate the profile of the art form and creates more demand for live performances of opera, or any other form, at the regional level. We all should hope so, Kaiser writes, because if it doesn't, expect to see a dramatic withering of the arts ecosystem in the future.\n\nKaiser aptly illustrates his prediction with an allusion to Huxley's Brave New World. Are we going to find a formula that will fortify and cultivate the arts in America, securing its place as a cornerstone of our culture and civilization, or will we all end up in a Soma-infused stupor consuming ersatz content designed to make us want to consume more of the same bland gruel? Or maybe we've already reached that point? Kaiser doesn't say. But consider yourself warned.\n\nFoundation Center's Daniel X. Matz reviews Michael M. Kaiser's latest take on the state of the arts in the United States....",

        "title":"Foundations and the SDGs: The 'Conspicuous Absentees' Speak Out",
        "content":"The philanthropic community has been \"conspicuously absent from the SDG debate,\" Kevin Watkins of the UK's Overseas Development Institutewrites in the March 2015 issue of Alliance magazine. However, as Watkins suggests, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will take final shape later this year, are likely to have a significant influence on the environment in which foundations operate. Caroline Hartnell and Andrew Milner, editor and associate editor of Alliance, asked a number of people from different regions why foundations should take the SDGs seriously, and how their influence is likely to make itself felt on their work both domestically and internationally. Responses suggested that, even if they haven't been part of the SDG debate so far, at least some foundations have been listening and thinking.\n\nPatricia Frias of Italy's Fondazione Cariplo proposes a possible reason for foundations' limited contribution to the debate so far. \"In times of crisis, foundations are often called to help and focus on community needs,\" she explains. \"This 'contingency grantmaking' prevails, even only provisionally, over medium- to long-term grantmaking strategies.\" She also believes that foundations operating mostly at the local level didn't perceive their contribution to the global dialogue as fundamental.\n\nWhile Frias believes a more extensive contribution by foundations to the debate about the SDGs would certainly have been desirable, she points out that their contribution will be even more important with respect to how the post-2015 agenda can be effectively implemented at global and local levels.\n\nThis is why Fondazione Cariplo, working jointly with the European Foundation Centre, organized a conference in Milan in September 2014 on \"The Role of and Opportunities for Foundations in Localizing the Post-2015 Agenda.\" The main recommendations coming out of the event can be summarized in two phrases, Frias says:\n\n\n    \"Think global and act local.\n    \"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\"\n\nA Much Improved Participatory Process\n\nPhilanthropic institutions may or may not have held themselves aloof from the process of devising the SDGs, but many of our respondents felt upbeat about the process. Comparing them with the Millennium Development Goals, Edmund Cain, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation's vice president of grant programs, speaks of a \"much improved participatory process\" and sees it as the furthest point of a long journey: \"Silo busters have infiltrated the insular worlds of academia, the UN, philanthropy, government, and the private sector. We are beginning to speak a common language, and the MDGs and SDGs have facilitated that conversation.\"\n\nSimilarly, Ana Toni of GIP in Brazil notes: \"The process of debate and construction of the Brazilian position on the SDGs has been much more participatory than with the MDGs.\" Brazilian foundations have been more closely involved in developing the Brazilian position, and \"this enhances the likelihood of making the SDGs a more relevant platform for Brazilian foundations.\"\n\nOpportunity for Collaboration\n\nMost of our respondents don't see the SDGs as suggesting different areas of work  with seventeen goals and one hundred and sixty nine objectives, pretty well everything is covered  so much as refinements on existing ones or opportunities to align their efforts with those of others. The existence of a common development agenda is seen as significant. One of the strongest themes to emerge from the responses to our survey is the need for collaboration among those involved in development and the opportunities the SDGs offer for such collaboration.\n\n\"If the SDGs provide the global mileposts that define success in meeting the defining challenge of our generation,\" says Cherie Nursalim, vice chair of Singapore's Giti Group and chair of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network for Southeast Asia, \"it is for the collaborative actions of all partners in the global community to contribute towards the road map that will take the world to these mileposts.\" The goals, he adds, must be \"co-owned, if not co-created, by all elements of the global community.\"\n\n\"One of the key elements of the post-2015 development agenda is catalyzing global solidarity for sustainable development,\" says Marcos Neto of the United Nations Development Programme. \"This means that only through collective efforts of all development actors is success feasible.\"\n\n\"Achieving substantial progress on the SDGs requires collective action instead of individual efforts,\" says Rana Kotan of the Sabanci Foundation in Turkey.\n\nAna Toni agrees: \"Using the SDG framework and forum may help foundations to avoid fragmentation and foster complementarity, which per se would increase their effectiveness.The SDGs are above all a platform to help foundations, together with governments, international cooperation agencies, and the private sector, to better coordinate their actions.\"\n\nAkwasi Aidoo, founding director of TrustAfrica until October 2014, also cites collaboration as a reason for foundations to take the SDG agenda seriously. They missed the boat with the MDGs, he thinks, and this is another opportunity \"to achieve greater impact and scale through collaboration and learning across sectors.\"\n\nOne definite achievement of the SDGs so far is the development of platforms to facilitate collaboration. For example, the Post-2015 Partnership Platform for Philanthropy is being piloted in five countries and is supported by the Rockefeller, Ford, Hilton, and MasterCard foundations, along with the UNDP and Foundation Center.\n\nOne of the main issues with the MDGs was that foundations didn't know who else was in the space they were working in  which made collaboration very difficult. As part of the Post-2015 Partnership Platform, Foundation Center is building the SDGfunders.org data portal, which will display foundation funding alongside OECD funding and other development indicators, and will enable foundations to share information on a regular basis.\n\nFinding the Right Role for Foundations\n\n\"The attempt to coordinate should not curtail one of the main assets of foundations, which is their freedom to take risks, to explore new frontiers, to support NGOs that challenge the status quo,\" cautions Ana Toni. Sustainability is \"not a technical problem,\" she adds  rather, it is \"a complex system of power relations which involves the tension of different social, political, and economic players in our societies.\" The framework the SDGs offer should not be allowed to obscure or simplify the complexities underlying each goal and objective.\n\nMarcos Neto also notes the potential significance of foundations' capacity for independent action: \"Foundations are risk takers, innovators, nimble and responsive, with the capacity to commit for the long term. These are all elements that will be needed in the SDGs' implementation.\"\n\n\"Collaborative activity is essential,\" says Cherie Nursalim, because it recognizes the advantages each sector has. And what advantage do foundations have? \"Philanthropic institutions can be an incubator of practical solutions and knowledge sharing, including through collaborations across the sectors. The SDSN-SEA workshop on sustainable energy and deep de-carbonization was an example.\"\n\nRana Kotan, too, argues for a foundation role in helping to create collaborations, rather than just participating in them. \"Foundations can build alliances between private sector, civil society, academia, and government to identify and implement innovative solutions to social problems, thus contributing to the achievement of the SDGs in line with their programmatic priorities.\"\n\nPatricia Frias feels that both roles  convener and innovator  could be important in achievement of the SDGs: \"Autonomy, flexibility, and appetite for risk and innovation. These features allow foundations to have a long-term, strategic, helicopter view and perform the role of a convener and agenda developer, giving more visibility to the issue. Moreover, foundations can work on a variety of levels  policy, practice, advocacy.\"\n\nKeeping the Record Straight\n\nRana Kotan also sees a role for philanthropy in helping to make governments  whom she sees as being the major instrument for implementing the SDGs  accountable for that implementation by making grants to watchdog civil society organizations. They can also take a convening role, bringing together other sectors to create a reliable data collection system to measure the implementation and effect of the SDGs. Patricia Frias echoes this, citing \"investment in documenting and sharing good practices\" and \"providing and supporting data and evidence gathering\" as a role for foundations in achieving the SDGs.\n\nHow Much Will the SDGs Affect Foundations' Work?\n\n\"The SDGs will dismantle the typologies of nations as we know them,\" says Marcos Neto. While it is true that the SDGs are revolutionary in how they apply equally to so-called developed and developing countries, none of our respondents see them leading to a dramatic change in foundation priorities  largely because with 17 goals and 169 objectives, the SDGs are bound to coincide with most foundations' existing interests at some point. As Patricia Frias notes, they embrace \"such a variety of areas that at least one is most likely an area of intervention [for any] foundation.\"\n\nBut how will a set of precepts that are conceived as having universal application determine the work of foundations locally? For African foundations, says Akwasi Aidoo, the SDGs won't mean a change of program area  most African foundations already cover the areas set out in the SDGs  but they will offer an opportunity to redefine their strategies. \"The SDGs offer African foundations a basis for holistic strategies in the sense that they would be able to more easily connect the service provision and policy levels of work needed for sustainable and scalable change as well as collaborating with other donors.\" African foundations can also \"help shape the implementation design of the SDGs by sharing their deep and comparative understanding of local contexts and the development landscape.\"\n\nPatricia Frias is not sure \"whether the new agenda will massively influence the focus of foundations' grantmaking strategies.\" Fondazione Cariplo, she says, has long been committed to \"the integration of social, environmental and economic agendas, stressing the importance of sustainable approaches and solutions in many key areas covered by the proposed SDGs.\"\n\nHowever, she suggests that what the SDGs will do is provide foundations with \"performance/effectiveness indicators in the areas covered by the post-2015 agenda.\" She also notes general agreement among foundations that they should become stronger players in the advocacy and policy fields and believes that \"the agenda may work both as stimulus and as support for these purposes.\"\n\nIn Turkey, while the Sabanci Foundation has its own program priorities based on national needs, Rana Kotan foresees the SDGs forming \"a strong anchor for the foundation while implementing these strategies, because most of the projects we support have a direct or indirect impact on the achievement of the SDGs.\" She cites goal #4 (quality education for all) and #5 (gender empowerment and equality of women and girls) as areas in which the foundation is already contributing significantly.\n\nShe also cites education as an area of potential collaboration in the service of the SDGs. \"One area where collaboration among Turkish foundations could make a real difference is education. If foundations can agree on a common set of principles and align reporting standards, this collaboration could potentially work. Sabanci Foundation would be open to engage in discussions with other Turkish foundations.\"\n\nWhat About Domestic Grantmaking in Developed Countries?\n\n\"The challenges of poverty, quality education, and quality health care are universal challenges that are directly related to our more focused domestic program efforts,\" says Edmund Cain. He offers the Hilton Foundation's Home for Good initiative as an example that illustrates how the SDGs might affect domestic grantmaking in developed countries and harks back to philanthropy's convening role. The Home for Good initiative in Los Angeles has brought \"government, philanthropy and the private sector together in a coalition to end veterans' homelessness in Los Angeles by the end of this year and to end chronic homeless in LA altogether by the end of 2016,\" Cain notes.\n\nAna Toni points out that some of the goals apply more forcibly to developed countries, for example those relating to climate change and sustainable consumption patterns.\n\n\"I have a nagging doubt as to how seriously a UK government is going to take the issue of universality of the SDGs for domestic agendas,\" says David Cutler, director of the UK's Baring Foundation. He has doubts about applying a set of principles that are intended to be universal in a domestic setting. Setting aside the fact that governments are already saying how difficult it would be to monitor such a broad agenda, he notes that \"where we already have universal reporting mechanisms, for instance on child rights, any critical observation by UN officials on our performance is generally greeted by intense irritation and then dismissed. Would this be any different?\"\n\nShaping the Work of Northern Foundations in the South\n\nAkwasi Aidoo believes that the SDGs should also inform the work of overseas grantmakers in Africa because the goals and targets \"capture the full spectrum of the transformational and development imperative of sub-Saharan Africa.\" Moreover, he adds, there is a sense of ownership rather than imposition in the region: \"[A]ll the governments here were actively and enthusiastically engaged in the process that produced the SDGs, and sub-Saharan African civil society organizations also played an important role in the process .The SDGs offer an exciting level playing field for foundations from both the Global North and South to focus on shared priorities in ways that avoid the distracting perceptions and accusations of foreign imposition, neocolonialism, and dependency.\"\n\nMarcos Neto points to the importance of the relationships foundations in the North have developed with their grantees. \"The SDGs have the potential to provide all of us international NGOs, grassroots civil society organizations, and social enterprises with a common language and a set of data and entry points.\" This, he believes, will permit more strategic interventions with greater impact from Northern foundations in the Global South.\n\nDavid Cutler is more cautious. He agrees that the SDGs seem set to shape the next chapter of international development in the way that the MDGs did. However, he finds it hard to see just where and how an individual foundation's work will fit in the overall schema. His foundation will be pursuing LGBTI rights in Africa as its new focus. \"It is extremely welcome that the secretary-general's synthesis report includes LGBTI rights under justice.\" How much of a priority this will be is debatable, he says, but he concedes that it will be \"a very welcome opportunity for leverage if LGBTI rights makes it into the final SDGs in a legible way.\"\n\nAs he also very pertinently notes, \"we havent even got there yet.\"\n\nThe SDGs won't take on their final form until September. Our mini-survey suggests that whatever form the SDGs take, and however muted their voices are in the evolution of them, foundations see in the SDGs both the means and the opportunity to unite their efforts with those of others, as well as a larger frame within which to set (and if necessary revise) their own programs in pursuit of what Kevin Watkins calls \"the defining challenge or our generation.\"\n\nAndrew Milner and Caroline Hartnell are associate editor and editor, respectively, of Alliance.\n\nIn the latest installment of our Alliance@PND series, Caroline Hartnell and Andrew Milner share the results of a mini-survey of foundation and NGO leaders' thoughts about the Sustainable Development Goals to be announced later this year.",

        "content":"In this Cousins Research Group Report, David Mathews describes two different civic engagement movements. One is underway in higher education. On campuses across the country, leadership and service learning programs are growing, and students are taught civic skills, including civil dialogue. In addition, university partnerships with nearby communities offer technical assistance, professional advice, and access to institutional resources. The other is occurring off campus, in communities that are trying to cope with natural disasters, economic change, and other problems that threaten everyone's well-being. In these places, citizens say they want to come together as communities to maintain their communities. Unfortunately, they often have difficulty finding institutions that understand their agenda.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Why are these two civic movements in danger of passing like the proverbial ships in the night? Mathews explores this disconnect, noting, &quot;It would seem that two civic engagement movements, occurring at the same time and often in the same locations, would be closely allied -- perhaps mutually reinforcing. That doesn't seem to be happening very often.&quot; He goes on to suggest how these efforts might become mutually supportive.",

        "content":"The passage of China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) by the U.S. House of Representatives in late May 2000 over the overwhelming will of the American people was the result of the most forceful and aggressive corporate legislative campaign in history. Despite four-to-one public opposition, the bill was passed by the use of unprecedented amounts of corporate money in political contributions, advertising, lobbying and rented &quot;experts,&quot; as well as the application of the White House s full resources. To fulfill their own overlapping goals, the corporate coalition and the White House worked in such tight coordination that the General Accounting Office has reported that federal law on Executive branch lobbying practices was violated. Deaf to pleas from even pro-PNTR House Democrats, the administration launched the China PNTR crusade to build a legacy for the President knowing it would damage Democrats chances to regain a House majority. To celebrate the House PNTR vote, President Clinton went out that night to a corporate political fund-raiser boycotted by many Democratic House Leaders. The corporate interest was in eliminating the annual Congressional review of China trade and to obtain unconditional, unlimited access to the U.S. market for goods produced in China. The day after the House vote, the Wall Street Journal and other papers finally reported that the corporations were not so much interested in access to the Chinese market to sell goods there, but rather sought guaranteed U.S. access for goods they could produce in China with its remarkably high-quality, cheap, government-controlled labor and lax environmental controls. Passing China PNTR was an important priority for both players for another important and symbolic reason: the proponents of corporate globalization and corporate managed trade had been defeated for five years by a determined citizen s movement that recognized that the corporate and White House globalization agenda was benefitting narrow corporate interests at the expense of working families and the environment. The Clinton administration and the corporate lobbies had pushed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which established the World Trade Organization (WTO) through the Congress during the administration s first term. While the NAFTA and WTO fights required concerted corporate lobbying and public relations efforts, obtaining political support for expanding existing globalization policies had become much more difficult. Polling showed that people had become aware of the all-too-real down sides of what its proponents dubbed &quot;free trade,&quot; but was increasingly revealed to be corporate managed trade. Several years after NAFTA's passage when its negative impacts became apparent, public opinion, never supportive of the corporate-White House trade agenda, turned frosty. Significant relocation of high-wage manufacturing jobs to Mexico, increased border pollution and health problems, and the declining safety of America s increasingly imported food supply made the public increasingly skeptical of the promises and projections made by the &quot;free trade&quot; proponents.

This is a welcome development -- new businesses are the engine of job creation in the United States economy and an important source of innovation and productivity. Perhaps most importantly, the rise in new business formation between 2010 and 2011 was geographically dispersed throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; While the rise of new business creation in 2011 is a significant development -- it is the first annual gain in five years and the largest percentage annual increase in nearly a decade -- the bulk of this paper examines two classes of new businesses that most closely resemble entrepreneurship: companies less than one year old with one to four employees and those with fine to nine. This analysis finds that the smallest of these new firms represent most of the increase in firm formation in 2011:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; * New companies with one to four employees comprise the vast majority of new businesses formed each year, accounting for, on average, 86 percent of new firms since the late 1970s in the BDS data. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Job creation at new businesses of all sizes increased by 4.3 percent, and rose by 5.4 percent in new companies with one to four employees, reversing four consecutive years of decline for those smallest companies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Companies less than one year old with one tofour employees have created, on average, more than 1 million jobs per year over the past three decades; those with five to nine employees have added, on average, half a million jobs per year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * With a promise of more detailed analysis infuture reports, this paper presents maps that illustrate the increased share of new business formation in most states and metro areas across the nation.",

        "content":"The strength of the manufacturing sector is fundamental to the overall economic performance of Illinois and the U.S. as a whole. The manufacturing sector in Illinois create large numbers of jobs that pay high wages to workers, purchases more goods and services from within the state than any other sector, and constitutes a main component of the state export economy. For these and other reasons, manufacturing needs be at the center of all government discussions on economic policy.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Center for Labor and Community Research (CLCR) was commissioned by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association to analyze the condition of the Illinois manufacturing sector. We found that Illinois manufacturing is essential to Illinois' economy, and although it is among the top manufacturing states in the country, it faces a number of challenges. This report demonstrates why and how Illinois manufacturing matters, explains the current challenges it faces, and recommends actions to overcome some of these challenges. In addition to looking at manufacturing as a whole, this report looks at four key manufacturing sectors, or clusters, that together account for 64% of manufacturing employment in the state. These are the metals, electrical, printing, and food manufacturing sectors.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  A few key findings that CLCR uncovered in this study include the following: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing is vital to the state's economy and workers. Manufacturing exports create significant employment opportunities in Illinois, and the state's manufacturing workers are the most productive in the nation by far.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like other U.S. states, Illinois faces increasing competition from low-wage producers in the developing world as well as from highly skilled producers in developed countries. In order to remain competitive into the future, the sector requires increased investments in its infrastructure and workers and an improved workforce development system in order to increase the value-added component of their products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Illinois manufacturing sector needs a &quot;High Road&quot; partnership with government and labor to increase investment in infrastructure and workforce development, to support the sector by creating specialized service centers that provide assistance to Illinois companies, and to effectively using public subsidies to reward and assist those companies that are pursuing High Road strategies of innovation and development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

In this 20th anniversary edition of a Worldwatch classic, the Institute's highly respected interdisciplinary research team argues that past successes -- such as the elimination of smallpox and the encouraging drop in birth rates in many countries -- prove that humanity is capable of redirecting itself in positive ways. Most encouraging, the world is sitting on the cusp of similar successes that could usher in a sustainable human civilization. The use of clean, renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaics for example, is growing at over 25 percent per year, and they are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Organic farming is the fastest-growing sector of the world agricultural economy, with the potential to rejuvenate rural communities from the Philippines to Sweden. And a quickening of religious interest in humanity's place in the natural environment could awaken a powerful new constituency to the cause of sustainability. The challenges are still immense, of course, as the book also documents, but the building blocks for a historic reinvention of human civilization are now within reach.",

We first look at the macro-economic impact of the total population flows from the EU-8 and EU-2 to the EU-15 economies between 2004 and 2009. The aggregate population flows to the EU-15 are adjusted to reflect the age structure and education level of the mobile population. We also consider the impact of remittances. We then attempt to quantify the share of population movements that have occurred since 2004 and 2007 that can be attributed to the enlargement process itself, and the share that is likely to have occurred even in the absence of EU expansion. We finally look at the impact that transitional restrictions on the free mobility of labour have had on the distribution of EU-8 and EU-2 citizens across the EU-15 countries.",

What was once seen as a plague, especially in urban areas, is now at least manageable in most places. Rarely has there been such a rapid change in mass behavior. This observation begs two central questions: Why has crime fallen? And to what degree is incarceration, or other criminal justice policy, responsible? Social scientists and policy experts have searched for answers. Various explanations have been offered: expanded police forces, an aging population, employment rates, and even legalized abortion. Most likely, there is no one cause for such widespread, dramatic change. Many factors are responsible.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This report isolates two criminal justice policies -- incarceration and one policing approach -- and provides new findings on their effects on crime reduction using a regression analysis. This report issues three central findings, which are summarized: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased incarceration at today's levels has a negligible crime control benefit:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One policing approach that helps police gather data used to identify crime patterns and target resources, a technique called CompStat, played a role in bringing down crime in cities:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain social, economic, and environmental factors also played a role in the crime drop:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

These provisions include the creation of new Health Insurance Marketplaces where low and moderate income families can receive premium tax credits to purchase coverage and, in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs, the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to almost all adults with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The ACA has the potential to reach many of the 47 million Americans who lack insurance coverage, as well as millions of insured people who face financial strain or coverage limits related to health insurance. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Though implementation is underway and people are already enrolling in coverage, policymakers continue to need information to inform coverage expansions. Data on the population targeted for coverage expansions can help policymakers target early efforts, provide insight into some of the challenges that are arising in the first months of new coverage, and evaluate the ACA's longer-term effects. The Kaiser Family Foundation has launched a new series of comprehensive surveys of the low and moderate income population to provide data on these groups' experience with health coverage, current patterns of care, and family situation. This report, based on the baseline 2013 Kaiser Survey of Low-Income Americans and the ACA, provides a snapshot of health insurance coverage, health care use and barriers to care, and financial security among insured and uninsured adults across the income spectrum at the starting line of ACA implementation. The report also examines how findings from the baseline survey can help policymakers understand and address early challenges in implementing health reform.",

The purposes of the study were to first develop a clearer picture and understanding of the refugee dynamic in Onondaga County -- the needs, the service continuum and the opportunities new refugee populations offe and then to recommend programming and policies to help it be a more welcoming community. The lessons learned crossed sectors from literacy to public safety, and offer information both in process and potential.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The community has a long history of welcoming people from around the world and has seen an increase in New Americans in the last four to five years, as global unrest has grown. The higher numbers, coinciding as they did with an economic downturn that hurt all residents of the community, made the refugee presence more noticeable and for some, more problematic. Underlying the study was an unspoken question -- does Onondaga County have the resources and the willingness to welcome this population in a way that helps them without negatively affecting others with human service needs? &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The actions recommended might be targeted towards helping this new population, but were built on the premise that by helping them, Onondaga County (and other communities) help themselves.",

        "content":"Public education is an end, not a means. For a democratic nation to thrive, its schools must prepare children not only for success in private life but for participation in public life. It must foster harmonious social relations among the disparate groups in our pluralistic society and ensure universal access to a quality education. Unfortunately, the American school system has long fallen short as a means of fulfilling these purposes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This paper offers a more effective way of delivering on the promise of public education, by ensuring that all families have the means to choose their children's schools from a diverse market of education providers. All education providers -- government, religious, and secular -- can contribute to public education because all can serve the public by educating children. Educational freedom can most effectively be realized through nonrefundable education tax credits -- for both parents' education costs for their own children and taxpayer donations to nonprofit scholarship funds. This paper argues that tax credits enjoy practical, legal, and political advantages over school vouchers. These advantages are even more important for choice programs that target low-income children, as tax credits mitigate some disadvantages inherent to targeted programs. It also contends that broad-based programs are superior to narrowly targeted ones, even when the goal is specifically to serve disadvantaged students. Targeted programs are fundamentally inferior -- in both practical and strategic terms -- to broad-based programs that include the voting middle class. Finally, accountability in education means accountability to parents and taxpayers. Education tax credits afford this accountability without the need for intrusive government regulations that create political and market liabilities for school choice policies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To date, school choice policy has spread and grown only slowly, in part because of inadequate legislation. Existing school choice laws fall short in terms of both market principles and political considerations. Pursuing a policy that follows more closely what works economically and politically should increase the likelihood of long-term legislative success, program success, program survival, and program expansion.",

Does it lower citizens' knowledge of information relevant to their votes? Who benefits from campaign spending? Studies indicate that campaign spending does not diminish trust, efficacy, and involvement, contrary to what critics charge. Moreover, spending increases public knowledge of the candidates, across essentially all groups in the population. Less spending on campaigns is not likely to increase public trust, involvement, or attention. Implicit or explicit spending limits reduce public knowledge during campaigns. Getting more money into campaigns should, on the whole, be beneficial to American democracy.",

Funding was also made available from the Ford Foundation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This brief is part of a policy brief series by the Rural Sociological Society and the Regional Rural Development Centers that stresses the importance of community collective action and developing the capacity of people and organizations to meet the community's needs&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Rural Sociological Society and the Regional Rural Development Centers creates new Public Policy Issue Brief series based on its recent book, &quot;Challenges for Rural America in the Twenty-First Century&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The briefs synthesize the context and substance of important issues raised in the book and address alternative policy options, with the goal of bringing important research to the policy community.",

        "title":"Assessing Learning Through the Arts",
        "content":"Within the past several decades, the emphasis in public education nationwide has steadily moved away from arts-rich and creativity based learning toward more standardized, test-based learning. In recent years, budget cuts and the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; have pushed the education climate even further toward high-stakes testing, narrowing curriculum. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In line with this, Washington State has enacted the Washington Assessment of Student Learning standards, shifting local schools' priorities toward meeting test-based standards. At the same time, public education in Washington state faced significant budget cuts. By 2005, Washington ranked 42nd in the nation in public education spending.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Public schools have had to cut many rich program offerings including in-school arts classes. In 2005, nearly 60 percent of Washington State principals reported one hour or less of music instruction per week in their schools. Worse yet, 60 percent of Seattle Public School elementary schools offered no visual arts program that same year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; During this time, several existing organizations in King County and countless more practitioners were growing to meet a new demand for the arts gap through diverse, innovative programming both in and out of the school day. Seattle's nonprofit arts education organizations were natural advocates for more creative learning opportunities but remained somewhat disconnected from each other, lacking a cohesive, persuasive message to more effectively advocate for arts education. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In response to these challenges, among others, seven of these regional nonprofit youth arts education organizations formed the Seattle Arts Education Consortium (Consortium), a collaborative, two-year project, in the summer of 2005.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Reflecting on the work of the last two years, the Consortium offers several key findings and lessons learned related to both the process and the product. These findings may be an excellent resource to any group starting a similar process and especially for arts education programs hoping to elevate the rigor and public understanding of their programs' impacts. This report will also be useful to foundations interested in encouraging collaborations among their grantees.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The sections that follow include descriptions of the process, outcomes and findings for each project activity including: Evaluation Planning & Implementation, Professional Development for Teaching Artists, Arts Education Communications & Messaging as well as What's Next for the Consortium.",

        "title":"Bicycles Pedaling Into the Spotlight",
        "content":"The world produced an estimated 130 million bicycles in 2007 -- more than twice the 52 million cars produced. Bicycle and car production tracked each other closely in the mid-to-late 1960s, but bike output separated sharply from that of cars in 1970, beginning its steep climb to 105 million in 1988. Following a slowdown between 1989 and 2001, bike production has regained steam, increasing in each of the last six years. Much of the recent growth has been driven by the rise in electric, or &quot;e-bike&quot; production, which has doubled since 2004 to 21 million units in 2007. Overall, since 1970, bicycle output has nearly quadrupled, while car production has roughly doubled.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Promoting the bike as a clean and efficient alternative to the personal automobile is a practical way for cities to reduce traffic congestion and smog. To simultaneously confront those problems as well as climate change and an emerging obesity epidemic, government leaders and advocacy groups are working to bring cycling back to prominence in the urban transport mix.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A number of European cities have set the standard for bicycle use and promotion, via pro-bike transportation and land use policies, as well as heavy funding for bicycle infrastructure and public education. In Copenhagen, for example, 36 percent of commuters bike to work. The city plans to invest more than $200 million in bike facilities between 2006 and 2024 and estimates that by 2015 half its residents will bike to work or school. In Amsterdam, cycling accounts for 55 percent of journeys to jobs that are less than 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) from home. The government has pledged to spend $160 million from 2006 to 2010 on bicycle paths, parking, and safety. And Freiburg, Germany, a city with 218,000 people, has allocated roughly $1.3 million annually for cycling since 1976; now some 70 percent of local trips there are made by bike, on foot, or by public transit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Governments elsewhere are following Europe's lead. Bogota, Colombia, boasts more than 300 kilometers of bikeways, the most for a city in the developing world. In Australia, the state of Victoria has amended planning laws to require all new large buildings to provide bike parking and other facilities such as showers and lockers. And in November 2007, South Korea's Home Affairs Ministry announced a new pro-bike campaign to alleviate increasing traffic and air pollution and to cope with soaring oil prices. As it expands bicycle infrastructure, the government aims to substantially increase bike ownership by 2015, from one bike for every seven citizens to one for every four.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Some notoriously polluted and congested cities are working to reap the benefits of cycling as well. Mexico City plans to have 5 percent of all trips be by bike in 2012, up from less than 2 percent today, using traffic calming methods, promotional campaigns, and bike-transit connectivity. In India, Delhi's newest Master Plan requires fully segregated bicycle tracks on all arterial roads and notes that promoting cycling will be an essential component of the city's plans to reduce growth in fossil fuel consumption. (See additional examples of bicycle promotion initiatives.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bicycle rental programs are also increasing bike use in some cities. The stand-out example of 2007 was Paris's low-cost Valib rental scheme, launched in July. Now offering 20,600 bikes that can be obtained by credit card at 1,451 stations, the program logged 6 million rides in its first three months. Analysts expect the program to double or even triple bike trips in Paris. Similar programs exist in Oslo, Barcelona, and Brussels and are planned for Washington, D.C., and central London, among other cities.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While biking remains popular for recreation in the United States, it is woefully underused for transportation. Total cycling participation has declined nationally since 1960, dropping 32 percent since the early 1990s, and now accounts for just 0.9 percent of all trips. Cycling to work is even less frequent, at 0.4 percent of trips.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Despite these unimpressive statistics, encouraging signs can be seen for the future of cycling in the United States. Aided by $900 million a year in federal funding for promotion of biking and walking for 2005 to 2009, the installation of bicycle facilities -- including parking, bike-friendly roads, and designated lanes -- is proceeding at a record pace. Indeed, plans in the 50 largest U.S. cities would, on average, double their bicycle and pedestrian routes; New York City alone will quadruple its bike network to 2,900 kilometers by 2030.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bicycle advocacy in the United States continues to grow as well. The League of American Bicyclists now honors 84 U.S. towns and cities as Bicycle Friendly Communities, compared with 52 in 2005. Cycling advocacy groups operate in 49 states and Washington, D.C. Perhaps most exciting, a Complete Streets movement has blossomed in recent years, in which a broad coalition of citizen and environmental groups is calling for safer, pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly roads designed for everyone, not just cars. Six states and more than 50 cities, counties, and metro regions have now enacted some form of Complete Streets legislation. For example, the Illinois General Assembly voted last October to require all new state transportation construction projects in and around urban areas to include bicycle and pedestrian ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While the bicycle is still an essential form of transportation in China, the country has recently seen a rapid decrease in bike ownership as its population becomes wealthier and turns to cars. From 1995 to 2005, China's bike fleet declined by 35 percent, from 670 million to 435 million, while private car ownership more than doubled, from 4.2 million to 8.9 million. Blaming cyclists for increasing accidents and congestion, some city governments have closed bike lanes. Shanghai even banned bicycles from certain downtown roads in 2004. This deterioration in Chinese bike culture emerges even as the country's share of world bicycle production continues to rise: China now turns out more than four fifths of the 130 million bikes produced each year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; China's central government, increasingly concerned about traffic congestion, energy consumption, and people's health, has now begun calling on cities to reverse this discouragement of bikes. In June 2006, Deputy Minister of Construction Qiu Baoxing ordered cities that had narrowed or removed bike lanes to restore them. Within Beijing, bike promotion is having some visible effects as the city prepares for the 2008 Olympics. For example, after successful pilot projects, a private bike rental scheme co-sponsored by Beijing's environmental protection and security bureaus aims to provide 50,000 bikes at some 200 locations by August. Thus far, however, the recent pro-bicycle rhetoric from Beijing has not translated into much positive action outside the capital.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Development projects addressing disease and poverty in Africa provide evidence that the bicycle's utility is not just limited to urban areas. In Zambia, World Bicycle Relief has partnered with a coalition of relief organizations to combat HIV/AIDS through more timely education and treatment, providing 23,000 bicycles to healthcare volunteers, disease prevention educators, and families affected by the virus. In Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Uganda, an alliance of Dutch non-governmental organizations has launched a micro-credit lending program called Cycling Out of Poverty. Through this effort, poor people can pay off leased bikes while using them to attend school or start a small business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With more than half the world's population now living in cities, there is tremendous potential for municipal governments and urban planners to increase bicycle use by following classic European examples like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. These cities have shown that by integrating bicycles in transportation planning, educating the public about cycling's benefits, and discouraging driving with restrictions and taxes on car ownership and parking, governments can greatly enhance bicycle use. This promotes people's physical fitness while helping to create cleaner, more livable communities.",

To make the argument, we present a usable definition of voter fraud, discuss the problem of evidence, and explain how and why the dynamics of electoral competition drive the use of baseless fraud claims in American politics. We present several contemporary examples to illustrate how poor election administration and voter mistakes are misleadingly labeled &quot;fraud.&quot; Recent allegations against voter registration campaigns highlight the need for an analysis sensitive to the partisanship and race and class issues just beneath the surface of most voter fraud claims. The last section of the report makes policy recommendations for improving public understanding and removing the canard of voter fraud from the election reform debate. The appendix discusses what to look for in evaluating voter fraud allegations.",

        "content":"To help inform policymakers and the public about the progress of education in the United States, Congress has mandated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) produce an annual report, &quot;The Condition of Education.&quot; This year's report presents 42 indicators of important developments and trends in U.S. education. These indicators focus on population characteristics, participation in education, elementary and secondary education, and postsecondary education.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As this year's Condition shows, in 2012, about 90 percent of young adults ages 25 to 29 had a high school diploma, or its equivalent, and 33 percent had a bachelor's degree or higher. As in previous years, annual median earnings in 2011 were higher for those with higher levels of education -- for example, 25- to 34-year-olds with a college degree earned over twice as much as high school dropouts.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In 2011, almost two-thirds of 3- to 5-year-olds were enrolled in preschool, and nearly 60 percent of these children were in full-day programs. At the elementary and secondary level, there were about 50 million public school students in 2011, a number that is expected to grow to 53 million in the next decade. Of these students, nearly 2 million attended charter schools. Postsecondary enrollment in 2011 was at 21 million students, including 18 million undergraduate and 3 million graduate students. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; NCES's newest data on elementary and secondary schools show that about one in five public schools was considered high poverty in 2011 -- meaning that 75 percent or more of their enrolled students qualified for free or reduced-price lunch -- up from about to one in eight in 2000. In school year 2009 -- 10, some 3.1 million public high school students, or 78.2 percent, graduated on time with a regular diploma. And, in 2011, about 68 percent of recent high school completers were enrolled in college the following fall. Meanwhile, the status dropout rate, or the percentage of 16- to 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, declined from 12 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2011. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  At 4-year colleges in 2011, nearly 90 percent of full-time students at public and private nonprofit institutions were under the age of 25. However, only about 29 percent of full-time students at private for-profit colleges were, while 39 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and another 32 percent were 35 and older. About 56 percent of male students and 61 percent of female students who began their bachelor's degree in the fall of 2005, and did not transfer, had completed their degree by 2011. In that year, there were 1.7 million bachelor's degrees and over 700,000 master's degrees awarded.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Condition of Education 2013 includes the latest data available on these and more key indicators. As new data are released, the indicators will be updated and made available. Along with these indicators, NCES produces a wide range of reports and data to help inform policymakers and the American public about trends and conditions in U.S. education.",

        "content":"Global press freedom fell to its lowest level in over a decade in 2013, as hopes raised by the Arab Spring were further dashed by major regression in Egypt, Libya, and Jordan, and marked setbacks also occurred in Turkey, Ukraine, and a number of countries in East Africa. In another key development, media freedom in the United States deteriorated due primarily to attempts by the government to inhibit reporting on national security issues.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Meanwhile, as a result of declines in democratic settings over the past several years, the share of the world's population that enjoys a Free press remained at 14 percent, meaning only one in seven people live in countries where coverage of political news is robust, the safety of journalists is guaranteed, state intrusion in media affairs is minimal, and the press is not subject to onerous legal or economic pressures.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  These are the most significant findings of this report, the latest edition of an annual report published by Freedom House since 1980. While there were positive developments in a number of countries, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa, the dominant trends were reflected in setbacks in a range of settings.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The year's declines were driven by the desire of governments -- particularly in authoritarian states or polarized political environments -- to control news content, whether through the physical harassment of journalists covering protest movements or other sensitive news stories; restrictions on foreign reporters; or tightened constraints on online news outlets and social media. In addition, press freedom in a number of countries was threatened by private owners -- especially those with close connections to governments or ruling parties -- who altered editorial lines or dismissed key staff after acquiring previously independent outlets.These factors were behind the majority of the status downgrades for 2013, including the shifts from Partly Free to Not Free in Libya, South Sudan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Zambia. Significant declines also occurred in the Central African Republic, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Kenya, Montenegro, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Separately, influential authoritarian powers such as China and Russia continued to maintain a tight grip on locally based print and broadcast media, while also attempting to control the more independent views provided either in the blogosphere or by foreign news sources. Both countries introduced additional legal measures to penalize online speech in 2013. And while China focused on suppressing dissent on popular microblogging services and obstructing the foreign press, the Russian government closed RIA Novosti, a long-established news service, replacing it with an organization more openly under direct Kremlin control. Conditions in Eurasia remain bleak, with 97 percent of the region's population living in Not Free media environments.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Even more open media environments are not immune to pressure on press freedom. The year featured the most significant decline of the past decade in one of the world's largest democracies, the United States, due to government attempts to control official information flows, particularly concerning national security -- related issues; the legal harassment of journalists with regard to protection of sources; and revelations of surveillance that included both the bulk collection of communications data by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the targeted wiretapping of media outlets. Disclosures that surveillance was being conducted by a range of governments -- many of them democratic -- against ordinary citizens as well as key political figures intensified concerns on a global level about the ability of journalists and others who gather and disseminate news and information to protect sources and maintain their digital privacy.",

There are currently more than 60 community court projects in operation worldwide. In the United States alone there are 33 while there are 17 in South Africa, 13 in England and Wales, and one each in Australia and Canada.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Community courts seek to achieve a variety of goals, such as reduced crime, increased engagement between citizens and the courts, improved perceptions of neighborhood safety, greater accountability for low level,&quot;quality-of-life&quot; offenders, speedier and more meaningful case resolutions, and cost savings. In advancing these goals, community courts generally make greater use of community-based sanctions than traditional courts (Hakuta, Soroushian,and Kralstein, 2008; Katz, 2009; Sviridoff et al., 2000; Weidner and Davis, 2000).

        "content":"In virtually every for-profit industry, stiff competition breeds economic efficiency. Success hinges on producing more goods or services at a lower cost without compromising quality  that is, on increasing productivity. The classic example of the benefits of productivity gains is Henry Ford's adoption of the assembly line, an innovation that allowed his company to build more reliable cars at a faster pace and at a lower cost  transforming the automobile from a plaything for the wealthy to an everyday tool for ordinary Americans.\n\nBut in the nonprofit world, organizations have few external incentives to operate more efficiently. Indeed, many people are actually suspicious of efforts to increase nonprofit productivity. At a recent meeting of 20 nonprofit leaders, for example, we presented some of the Bridgespan Group's findings about the growth in size of nonprofits that serve young people. When we broached the topic of economies of scale  that is, the idea that larger organizations can produce more goods and services for less  most attendees said that they simply could not increase their productivity without compromising the quality of their services.\n\nIf these skeptics are correct, then the only way that nonprofits can increase their impact is by raising and spending more money. Yet for-profit companies routinely preserve and even improve the quality of their goods and services without increasing their costs. If nonprofits could be equally savvy about how they spend their existing dollars  that is, if they could increase their productivity  they could get more bang for their buck.\n\nSome nonprofits, such as Teach for America, have achieved exactly this result. Since its inception in 1989, the organization has recruited and trained 17,000 college graduates to teach in some of the country's neediest schools. Between 2001 and 2005, the cost to develop each Teach for America teacher increased 12 percent each year. But at the same time, the percentage of Teach for America teachers who hit their performance benchmarks increased about 24 percent each year. And so although the organization's cost per teacher increased during this period, its cost per successful teacher decreased by approximately 10 percent each year.\n\nTeach for America is not the only nonprofit that has increased its productivity. Our recent study reveals that Jumpstart and Year Up, two other nonprofits serving young people, have also found ways to deliver the same or better services without increasing their costs.\n\nSo productivity gains can happen  nonprofits can increase their efficiencies. But they don't just happen. Productive nonprofits standardize their best practices, invest in essential people and processes, manage their costs, and measure their progress. Adopting these practices is not easy, because of the nature of nonprofits' work and prevailing funding practices. Nevertheless, Teach for America, Jumpstart, and Year Up all managed to overcome these obstacles and multiply their impact.\n\nNot surprisingly, these findings largely dovetail with those of researchers who have examined productivity in other sectors. But although there are scores of studies related to productivity in the forprofit sector, we have not been able to identify comparable studies in the nonprofit sector. We hope this small study sparks many more.\n\nTwo Paths to Productivity\n\nMeasuring productivity can be a tricky matter, even in the for-profit sector. Companies often have to go beyond tracking cost per widget produced. A classic example is that of the tire manufacturer. When a consumer buys a tire, he or she typically takes into account not just the cost of the tire but also the number of miles it will travel. Technological advancements may increase the cost of each tire, but decrease the cost of each mile traveled on it  and the latter is the metric that matters most to the consumer. The tire company that focuses on cost per tire is likely to be bested by one that grasps the true unit of value to the consumer and focuses on tire cost per mile traveled.\n\nThis same concept of value applies to the work of nonprofits. It's not cost per output (such as a youth served) that provides a window into productivity, but rather cost per outcome (a youth who achieves the results targeted by the organization). Here's where things get more complicated for nonprofits, though. Although it's relatively easy to calculate tire cost per mile (i.e., the tire's total cost divided by the number of miles it will go), it's far harder to calculate dollars required for a nonprofit to achieve an outcome, for reasons we will explore below.\n\nLet's back up and define some terms. Outputs are the amount of work a nonprofit does  in other words, the quantity of the programs or services it delivers. In the case of Year Up this would be the number of students participating in the program. Outcomes, in contrast, are the results of the nonprofit's work  in other words, the benefits for participants during or after their involvement with the organization. At Year Up this would be the number of graduating students placed in livable-wage jobs. Finally, the success rate reflects the number of outputs that turn into outcomes  for example, the ratio of students in the program to those who go on to get jobs paying a livable wage.\n\nAs the equation below illustrates, there are two paths to increasing a nonprofit's productivity: reduce the costs of producing each output, or increase the number of outputs that turn into outcomes  in other words, increase the success rate. In practice, as these nonprofits show, organizations typically work on both facets of the equation.\n\nJumpstart improved its productivity by decreasing its cost per output while holding its success rate steady. Jumpstart's mission is to work toward the day when every child in America will enter school prepared to succeed. To this end, corps members work one-on-one with preschool students and their families to incorporate language and literacy into daily activities. The organization's output is the total number of students with whom corps members work, and its outcome is the number of students who achieve greater gains in school readiness than a comparison group.\n\nAt Jumpstart, staff salaries are the greatest expense. In 2002 management noticed that the organization's Boston site had twice as many staff members as its other sites, yet the other sites still turned out similar numbers of children ready for school. Armed with these data, Jumpstart could reduce the number of its Boston-region staff by almost half without worrying that it would be compromising the quality of its outcomes. In other words, Jumpstart reduced its cost per output by halving the number of salaries it paid at its Boston site while serving the same number of children equally well.\n\nYear Up likewise increased its productivity by reducing its cost per output. But the organization first had to spend money to save money. As part of its intensive training program, Year Up pays its students a biweekly stipend for the hours they have worked at their internships. Historically, Year Up gathered time sheets manually and processed the checks internally  a time-intensive process. Seeing more growth and expense on the horizon, the organization invested in a centralized mechanism for collecting student data at all of its sites. An automated process then translates the data into a format accessible for a payroll outsourcing partner, providing a scalable solution to a potentially expensive challenge. And so the organization is able to train the same number of young people for less cost.\n\nTeach for America, in contrast, improved its success rate. It did so by increasing the number of its recruits who turned into truly effective educators. As this example illustrates, efficiencies sometimes come from spending more money, not less: Spending more on each teacher increased the number of teachers who later proved successful in front of their classrooms. By spending more money on outputs, organizations may wind up spending less on outcomes because they increase their success rates.\n\nThe converse is also true. Reducing the cost per output can increase the cost per outcome if the measures taken to cut costs hurt the organization's success rates. Consider, for example, a youth development organization that assigns youths to case workers. If its leaders decide to try increasing caseloads as a cost-saving measure  say by having case managers work with six youths each instead of its past standard practice of working with four  they could very well be disappointed. The larger caseloads could decrease the effectiveness of workers' interactions, with the resulting decline in the organization's success rate more than trumping the salary cost savings. Such unintended consequences are one of the reasons that it is unwise to focus exclusively on either reducing costs or increasing success rates. Organizations have to consider the impact of their efforts on both variables to achieve the desired results.\n\nHow to Increase Productivity\n\nIncreased productivity doesn't just happen. Jumpstart, Teach for America, and Year Up observed four management basics: standardize best practices; invest in staff and critical activities; manage costs aggressively; and measure progress.\n\nStandardize Best Practices. All three organizations discovered and spread their most cost-effective practices throughout their organizations. Jumpstart, for example, has standardized every aspect of its program and made these practices available in hard copy guidebooks as well as on its intranet. Corps members can sign into the system at any time and get lesson plans and curricula. Teach for America has created a centralized information system to capture and share best practices. This sort of standardization helps to keep costs down by increasing efficiency: Staff spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time executing effective practices. It also ensures that all sites are using the practices that have been shown to lead to the best outcomes, which can have a positive effect on the organization's success rate.\n\nInvest in Staff and Critical Activities. All three organizations invested more in the activities most important to the success of their programs and the sustainability of their organizations. For example, in 2000 Teach for America embarked on an ambitious five-year growth plan. The organization knew that in order to attract the best college graduates it would have to invest more in on-campus recruiting. It also added staff positions to its teacher training and support teams, invested in better data management and communications systems across regions, and made a commitment to pay higher salaries to attract and retain better talent. Teach for America's leaders point to highly qualified and well-resourced teachers as propelling the organization's healthy success rate, and strong teacher retention as offsetting recruiting and training investments.\n\nJumpstart also invested in building its management capacity, noting that when it comes to salaries, \"paying more costs less.\" Although this may sound counterintuitive, the logic holds: Better compensation reduces turnover, increases the average experience level of the staff, and builds institutional knowledge.\n\nManage Costs Aggressively. All three organizations paid a great deal of attention to managing their costs, particularly with respect to major costs like salaries. At Year Up, overhead and training stipends  for both the participating students and the companies that provide them with internships  are the organization's two biggest costs. To manage overhead, Year Up constantly monitors its administrative and personnel ratios to keep them as low as possible, even as class sizes grow. Training stipends receive similar scrutiny. Year Up analyzes and experiments with stipend levels at each of its four sites to determine the minimum level necessary to secure target student and company participation levels, thus ensuring that its cost per output remains low.\n\nMeasure Progress. All three organizations established performance measurement systems to give them timely feedback about their costs, outputs, and outcomes. Year Up, for example, has created a set of PowerPoint performance dashboards for reporting regularly on six critical areas of their work: recruiting and retaining talented staff, cultivating a solid student pipeline, teaching marketable skills, providing high-quality service to corporate partners, positioning students for ongoing success, and creating a sustainable program infrastructure. The management team then sets performance benchmarks and rates its progress against each benchmark.\n\nTake the critical area \"positioning students for ongoing success,\" for example. Year Up breaks this area down into three metrics: average starting wage, graduate employment, and college attendance by class. The associated dashboard charts the data in these three subareas and then rates the performance of each relative to the benchmark goals, using a green, yellow, or red traffic light icon.\n\nWhy Nonprofits Don't Calculate Productivity\n\nThe three organizations in our study all tracked costs and measured outcomes. Yet none had brought its data together to calculate cost per outcome, even though all appreciated the value of this metric. One reason for this oversight is that as each organization accumulated experience, it refined its definition of a successful outcome, complicating the process of tracking the metric. Consider Jumpstart, which uses a tool called the \"School Success Checklist\" to assess its students' language, literacy, initiative, and social skills. As Jumpstart learned more about its programs and participants, it changed the checklist. In the 2001-02 school year Jumpstart increased the number of items from 10 to 15, and in 2003 it revised the ratings and subscales for each item yet again. To participate in our study, Jumpstart staff had to dig back into its historical data and restate them in terms of its new school success checklist.\n\nAnother challenge to tracking cost per outcome is the lag between the time when an organization incurs program costs and the time when it can measure outcomes. For example, Jumpstart cannot possibly know whether students have improved until the end of the school year. In contrast, the organization can readily calculate cost per output (specifically, cost per tutor hour), a more immediately useful measure that helps Jumpstart's managers understand what is happening right now. As a result, the internal pressure to monitor costs naturally points people toward cost per output rather than cost per outcome.\n\nThe time lag between when an organization incurs costs and when it realizes outcomes is even more pronounced when it makes a large investment in its program or infrastructure, because these costs may all show up in one year. The benefits, in contrast, may take years to appear. For example, Teach for America's cost per outcome actually increased for several years while its investments were taking hold, only to decrease in the longer term.\n\nMatching expenses to the outputs and outcomes of one specific cohort of youth is also difficult. For example, Teach for America's costs for a given fiscal year include the cost to support teachers who are already in the classroom and the costs to recruit and train new teachers, who will not teach until the following year. To calculate Teach for America's cost per outcome for this study, we had to break down and reassemble its cost, output, and outcome data.\n\nProductivity Blocks\n\nWithout broader-based research, we cannot say how widespread reductions in cost per outcome are in the nonprofit sector. Nevertheless, on the basis of Bridgespan's work over the years with more than 100 nonprofits, we suspect that nonprofits do not regularly or fully realize such reductions. The reasons are many, but several additional barriers (besides the ones already mentioned) stand out in particular.\n\nOne of the impediments to achieving increased productivity is the lack of funding for nonprogram expenses. Building information systems to track outputs, outcomes, and costs requires money. The staff time needed to analyze the data is also not cheap. Many nonprofits simply do not have the money to make these investments, and foundations and other donors are often unwilling to provide the funding. As a result, many nonprofits have only a rudimentary understanding of what their true costs per outcome and output are.\n\nA second reason why nonprofits do not pay more attention to productivity is that they face little pressure to do so. Some of the organizations in our study cited an internal desire to decrease their cost per outcome, but none of them mentioned any external pressure to do so. Businesses face unrelenting external pressure from customers and competitors to reduce prices while maintaining quality. Companies are also under pressure from investors to increase their earnings per share, which they can often achieve by increasing productivity.\n\nWhen funders and other stakeholders do focus on nonprofits' costs, they most often scrutinize cost per output, not cost per outcome. Year Up, for example, usually reports the cost per participating student, not the cost per student placed in a living-wage job. Similarly, Teach for America usually reports the cost to recruit, train, and place a teacher, not the cost to recruit, train, and place a successful teacher. Some funders even provide a fixed amount of funding per output. This focus on cost per output can be counterproductive if it is not married to a focus on maintaining or improving outcomes.\n\nThe difficulty of achieving scale presents another challenge. In the for-profit sector, building economies of scale is a well-understood and oft-practiced way to increase efficiency. Although scale does not automatically decrease cost per outcome, it often allows an organization to spread fixed costs over more activities and to accumulate experience faster. And so growth can help an organization reduce costs and learn more quickly. The three organizations we studied are larger than average, but none is among the largest in the sector. Given the fragmented nature of the nonprofit sector, with the vast majority of organizations having annual budgets under $1 million, it may be hard for the average nonprofit to achieve economies of scale.\n\nYet another barrier is the failure to sustain activities long enough to decrease their costs or improve their success rates. Foundations have a reputation for being more interested in supporting the next exciting idea than in continuing to support a proven idea or program. Accordingly, nonprofits that depend primarily on foundation support may find it difficult to sustain a given program  and therefore to accumulate the kind of experience that can lead to savings. The fact that two of the three organizations we studied received more funding from public sources than from foundations may not be entirely coincidental.\n\nJumpstart, Teach for America, and Year Up all give real-world proof that maintaining quality while reducing cost is not only a theoretical goal but also a practical possibility. We hope that this research will inspire more nonprofits to track and manage their cost per outcome. We also hope that it will encourage more funders to shift their focus from cost per output to cost per outcome and to provide nonprofits with the long-term unrestricted support that will enable them to do the same.\n\nWe recognize that changing the rules of the funder-grantee game is never risk-free. Wrongly applied, external pressure on nonprofits to focus on cost per outcome could simply become yet another reporting burden on capacity-strapped organizations. Foundations may also be tempted to compare two organizations' cost per outcome without taking into account important differences between them, such as the populations they serve or the kinds of overhead that they have to bear. Equally, it could lead nonprofits to shift their costs, to serve less needy populations, or to make unsustainable cost cuts.\n\nDone right, however, reducing cost per outcome will lead to more bang for the nonprofit buck  a greater impact across the whole range of issues that nonprofits grapple with on society's behalf. And impact, after all, is the true bottom line of nonprofit work.\n\nThe authors thank the nonprofit executives of the profiled organizations for sharing their experiences and data. We also thank our colleagues from the Bridgespan Group  Jeff Bradach, Meghan Gouldin, Jennifer Lee, Gail Perreault, and Nan Stone  for their thoughtful contributions.\n\nOur Research Methods We addressed two general questions in our study: Have any nonprofits maintained, or even improved, their outcomes while reducing costs? If so, how did they do it? We first identified nonprofits with a reputation for achieving results and managing costs. To keep the analysis simple, we focused on single-program, direct-service nonprofits in the fields of youth development and education. Three organizations emerged from our preliminary investigations  Jumpstart, Teach for America, and Year Up. For each organization we collected and analyzed a minimum of five years worth of cost, output, and outcome data. We also conducted detailed interviews with the organization's executive director, chief financial officer, director of research and evaluation, and other key people. Finally, we compared our findings to secondary research on efficiency studies in the public sector and in for-profit service companies.\n\nIn light of the composition and small size of our sample and the preliminary nature of the research, our findings are, at best, suggestive. Nevertheless, they do shed light on the central question of whether nonprofits can maintain, or even improve, the quality of their outcomes while reducing costs.

Yet few have paid attention to this topic in the nonprofit sector. Recognizing that increasing productivity could be a powerful way for nonprofit organizations to multiply the impact of their work, the authors explore how three nonprofits succeeded in reducing costs without sacrificing the quality of their services....",

        "content":"Capital campaigns are not only a chance for an organization to raise significant funding beyond annual campaign goals, they are a chance to inject new focus and energy into all levels of staff and structure. The high-potential capital campaign demands long-range focus, lateral integration throughout an organization, and they require just as much planning as they do asking. Those embarking on such a daunting and exciting project would do well to prepare themselves with Nonprofit Essentials: The Capital Campaign, by Julia Ingraham Walker. Part of the APF Fund Development Series, Walker  a capital campaign specialist with more than 20 years experience as an independent fundraising consultant  has written a guidebook suitable for senior staff members and fundraising professionals looking for an overview of the topic.\n\nWalker's primary emphasis is on the steps necessary to properly plan a capital campaign. Though these campaigns are typically mounted in order to raise funds for new or renovated facilities, many organizations find it useful to integrate them with endowment campaigns in order to sustain an organization in its long-range goals. Following this idea, Walker points out that because of a capital campaign's length and resource requirements, it can and should be used to reinforce or rebuild the organization's objectives. Organizations must spend time assessing their abilities to support the needs of a campaign, particularly in terms of staffing and in the willingness of the organization's senior staff and board members to commit their time and influence to the campaign. Walker stresses broad staff involvement and encourages a holistic view of long-term fundraising, all of which will contribute to the organization's health long after the campaign has closed.\n\nA variety of planning techniques and devices are discussed, including campaign plans, feasibility studies, campaign budgets, gift tables (or \"donor pyramids\"), and multimedia promotional materials. In lieu of case studies, each tool is explained both with anonymous anecdotes and fictional samples that show the tools in action. This further stresses the book's hands-on focus and broadens its appeal to a variety of nonprofits. In perhaps the most useful and detailed chapter, Walker leads readers step-by-step through the process of designing and making pitches to prospects, her bullet points giving concrete words and techniques to those who have planned their campaigns carefully yet still find themselves floundering when it comes time to request dollar amounts. As Walker points out, \"the biggest reason for solicitation failures is a failure to actually ask for money.\" Her smart, no-nonsense approach to \"the ask\" will bolster any fundraiser's skills.\n\nBeyond the step-by-step are a few points on new trends in philanthropy and advice for targeting new constituencies and the differences in tactics that may be necessary when approaching them. Walker also advises on how to build relationships with your capital campaign donors, particularly in terms of rewarding their gifts and maintaining positive and professional interactions, even when your perfectly-planned project hits a snag. Though the section on closing the campaign may seem anti-climactic, one would hope that future books in the \"Nonprofit Essentials\" series  perhaps on nonprofit sustainability  will further satisfy the appetites whetted by Walker's smart, interdependent approach to the capital campaign.\n\nFor citations to additional materials on this topic refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject headings heading \"Capital campaigns.\"\n\nWalker, a capital campaign specialist with more than twenty years experience as an independent fundraising consultant, has written a guidebook suitable for senior staff members and fundraising professionals, that discusses a variety of planning techniques and devices are discussed, including campaign plans, feasibility studies, campaign budgets, gift tables, and multimedia promotional materials....",

Championed by senators Hubert Humphrey (D-MN) and Jacob Javits (R-NY), the NEA fostered the development of regional theater, opera, ballet, symphony orchestras, museums, and other art organizations, and has changed the country's artistic landscape from a time when the arts were limited primarily to a few big cities. Over the past four decades, the NEA has awarded more than 124,000 grants in the areas of access to artistic excellence, learning in the arts, and partnership agreements, and 40 percent of its funds go to its state and regional partners. The agency created and funded the American Film Institute, and also sponsored the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and gave early, critical funding to the Sundance Film Festival, Steppenwolf Theatre Company, Minnesota Public Radio's \"A Prairie Home Companion,\" Spoleto Festival U.S.A., and PBS's \"Great Performances\" series.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nThe NEA's national initiatives include Shakespeare in American Communities, in cooperation with Arts Midwest; Great American Voices, twenty-four professional opera companies performing at military bases across the country through August 2006; and Operation Homecoming, a project in which U.S. troops and their families write about their wartime experiences in letters, poems, stories, and memoirs. The NEA sponsors three Arts Journalism Institutes designed to improve arts criticism in classical music, opera, theater, and dance; the National Medal of Arts for lifetime achievement in all art forms; and the National Heritage Fellowships, one-time prizes to master folk and traditional artists in recognition of their achievements and artistic excellence.\n\n\nWeb Site:\nThe NEA Web site details its initiatives and provides information on grant applications and recent grants, funding resources for artists, and well-known NEA-supported projects.

The Foundation for the Junior Blind provides programs and services for children, adults, and their families.\n\n\nBackground:\nFounded in 1953 by a dedicated group of volunteers, the foundation was built on the simple idea that youngsters who are blind deserve access to the same recreational opportunities as their peers who are able to see. The group began by holding weekend dances and expanded to offer activities such as horseback riding and river rafting. After more than fifty years, the foundation has grown to serve more than six thousand individuals each year with six programs that provide education, recreation, training, and rehabilitation.\n\n\nCurrent Programs:\nFor children, teens, and young adults who are blind or visually impaired, the foundation offers a number of programs, including Camp Bloomfield in the mountains of Malibu, California. Campers and their families enjoy a range of outdoor activities while learning independence skills and self-advocacy. Another foundation program that empowers visually impaired youth is Visions: Adventures in Learning, which provides unique experiences to children between the ages of thirteen and eighteen that teach them how to overcome physical and emotional obstacles, achieve goals, and develop self-confidence.\n\nThrough its Special Education School, the foundation offers individualized instruction for students ages three to twenty-one. With a high staff-to-student ratio, instructors work with students to develop independent living skills and achieve their greatest level of educational ability and independence. Young people between the ages of five and twenty-one can also experience group living with trained counselors through the foundation's Children's Residential Program.\n\nFamilies with infants and children under age three can turn to the foundation for infant development therapy, family support, vision services, professional consultations, and counseling in Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura counties. And for adults who are newly blind or visually impaired, the foundation's Davidson Program for Independence is a comprehensive rehabilitation program that provides life skills for community and home living, pre-vocational training, preparation for employment, self-advocacy, and independence.\n\n\nRecent Successes:\nIn response to an unemployment rate of 80 percent for blind individuals, the foundation launched the Student Transition and Enrichment Program (STEP) last year to provide career exploration and job training to teens and young adults in Southern California. STEP participants craft resumes, participate in mock interviews, learn from professionals who are blind or visually impaired, interact with their peers, and enjoy a weeklong internship. The program allows students to gain a better understanding of the issues faced by the blind or visually impaired in the workplace.\n\n\nWeb site:\nThe foundation's award-winning Web site, available in Spanish and English, provides information about the group's programs, news, and other opportunities to sighted individuals, as well as those who are blind or visually impaired. The site is equipped with text-only and font-size adjusters and is formatted to function with screen-reading software that reads content aloud to the user.\n\n\nFunding:\nThe foundation receives private contributions from individuals, groups, and corporations, as well as some government funding.

        "content":"As Barbara Goldstein notes in her preface, art in public places in the United States has greatly expanded from simple depictions of a hero in the town square. Beginning with the government-supported efforts of the Works Progress Administration, there has been a steady movement toward an embrace of the concept of \"public art\"  art within a public space that helps create a keen sense of place and community. Goldstein's book, drawn from a series of conferences sponsored by the Seattle Arts Commission, is designed to give a 360-degree view of the current-day public art world in the United States. Members of city and community governments, staff and administrators of art agencies, and artists themselves are given a practical introduction to all steps of the public art process from idea to installation and beyond.\n\nThe book is divided into several sections of essays by artists, administrators, curators, and legal experts from within the public art field. Sections on planning, funding (both private and governmental), and exhibiting a project are followed by an expansive middle section describing how individual artists, design teams, and communities can initiate public art projects. Case studies within this section discuss everything from the ephemeral public art of a half-trimmed/half-wild lawn to the way the Rosie the Riveter Memorial led to the creation of a new national park. The final sections of the book give examples of artist contracts, ways to plan programming around a new public art piece, project maintenance and record-keeping methods, and the legal rights of the public artist and community. The book concludes with a long list of print and video resources, research and advocacy associations, material suppliers, active art projects, and neighborhood matching-fund grant programs.\n\nGoldstein, Public Art Program Director in San Jose, draws on her long experience in this arena to link the book's sections together. Her examples show how different models work under different governmental or environmental circumstances, and she ensures that each section has a complete representation and cogent explanation of possible approaches; for example, in her chapter on government-based funding models, the full text of public ordinances guiding public art creation in several large and small cities are provided, along with fact sheets clearly summarizing the effects of each ordinance.\n\nLest city ordinances and artist contracts seem too dry, it should be noted that the book also celebrates the art of public art. Several essays underline, as artist Helen Lessick terms it, \"the glory and dream of public art,\" and the numerous illustrations throughout the book give a taste of the excitement that public art can generate. Public Art by the Book is both a practical and colorful guide to the public art world.\n\nFor citations to additional materials on this topic refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject headings \"Art\" or \"Arts.\"\n\nGoldstein's book is designed to give a 360-degree view of the current-day public art world in the United States and offer city and community governments, art agencies, and artists a practical introduction to all steps of the public art process from idea to installation and beyond....",

        "title":"In the Black with BRAC",
        "content":"In 1972, Bangladesh was in shambles. Two years earlier, a devastating tropical cyclone had ripped through the country, killing nearly half a million people and establishing itself as one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern times. A few months later, the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out. Fought to establish the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the war claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and sent roughly ten million people fleeing to India. When Pakistan surrendered in December 1971, many of these refugees flooded back to Bangladesh, where they found their homes destroyed, their jobs gone, and their economy in ruins.\n\nBut Fazle Abed had an idea about how to help. Born and raised in what is now Bangladesh, Abed had spent most of the 1960s in the United Kingdom. There he studied accounting and business as an undergraduate and then worked as a corporate financial officer for Shell Ltd. Abed was in Bangladesh during the cyclone but returned to London during the Liberation War to generate support for the independence of Bangladesh. When the war ended in 1971, he decided to come home. \"Being confronted with the massive devastation of the cyclone was a life-changing experience, compounded by the Liberation War,\" he says. \"Ultimately, I decided that I wanted to devote my life to helping my people.\" Abed left his comfortable life in London and returned to a remote area of northeastern Bangladesh. He used the proceeds from the sale of his London flat to establish the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (now called BRAC).\n\nBRAC's first mission was to meet the immediate needs of war refugees. In some two hundred remote villages, the organization built houses, established health clinics, distributed food, and gave boats to fishermen who had lost theirs in the cyclone. Within a year, the organization had moved most of the refugees out of crisis. Yet the people remained impoverished, and vulnerable to becoming more so.\n\nSo BRAC set about building businesses that would not only help its clients become self-sufficient, but also keep the organization and its numerous programs afloat. BRAC's first social enterprise was a printing press that supplied books and other printed materials to the organization's schools and education programs. Owning a press was a way to cut printing costs and to reclaim the profits that the private sector was previously getting. At the same time, the business provided jobs and valuable training for BRAC's clients, serving the organization's mission to alleviate poverty. In its first year of operation, the press made $17,400 in profits. By 2007, it was generating $340,000 in profits.\n\nNow BRAC is the largest nonprofit in the world, reaching 110 million people annually through its health, education, and economic development programs. The organization generates 80 percent of its $485 million budget from its social enterprises, which include In the Black with BRAC microlending institutions, craft shops, printing presses, and dairy projects. BRAC's successes resonate throughout the country and the world: Major international organizations such as the World Bank credit BRAC and other nongovernmental organizations with turning Bangladesh around economically, in spite of the country's weak governance (two former prime ministers, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, are in jail on charges of corruption). Bangladesh is now enjoying such strong economic growth that it could join the ranks of middle-income countries by 2016, the World Bank projects.\n\nMany in the United States are skeptical about social enterprises, pointing out that most are unprofitable and that few nonprofits can sustain themselves solely through income-generating activities. Yet BRAC has managed to buck the trends. Its social enterprises have reaped enormous profits while also benefiting the organization and its clients. BRAC has succeeded by honing the fundamentals of social enterprise: build a strong organization first, choose businesses wisely, know when to let go of struggling businesses, and listen closely to stakeholders.\n\n\nWhy Enterprise?\nSocial enterprises are trendy, and with good reason. They can give clients jobs, training, and even markets for their products. In addition, social enterprises can generate surplus cash and thereby secure a reliable funding stream for nonprofit programs. More money, in turn, means more fuel for growth.\n\nGrowth was particularly important to Abed because the population of Bangladesh had tremendous unmet needs. \"The entire country was destroyed,\" he explains. \"How could I focus on only one region when all the others had great needs? It became clear that we needed to scale BRAC's programs across the country.\" Although BRAC was attracting donations and foreign aid in its early years, Abed did not want to rely on these sources, because they can be unreliable and even fickle.\n\nMoreover, charitable funding would not support the innovations and experiments that BRAC needed for growth. \"Typically, donors only like to fund things that have already been tested and will work,\" says Abed. \"But pilots are critical for us so we can know what will work and what will not, so that we can grow responsibly and in the right ways.\"\n\nBy generating its own income, BRAC could freely try out new ideas. For example, BRAC used the profits from its printing press business to pilot a novel oral rehydration program. The program was effectively a nonprofit public health program to teach parents how to make an electrolyte-rich fluid for children with diarrhea. The fluid prevents dehydration, which proves deadly to many millions of children in the developing world every year. BRAC initially trained four thousand oral rehydration workers (ORWs) and then sent them out to educate some thirty thousand families. Accurate and effective teaching was extremely important because if parents gave their children too much of the solution, the children could get even sicker. So BRAC rewarded the ORWs with a performance-based incentive system: The more each parent remembered, the higher the ORW's salary. Over the course of ten years, BRAC's oral rehydration program reached fourteen million of Bangladesh's nineteen million households. The program is widely believed by the public health community to have played a major role in halving the country's infant mortality rate, with government surveys showing that 70 percent of families in Bangladesh use BRAC's oral rehydration solution to treat diarrhea.\n\nEmboldened by the oral rehydration program, Abed realized that BRAC could use funds from social enterprises to pilot and spread other types of programs throughout Bangladesh. While the oral rehydration campaign was in full force, BRAC launched its second social enterprise, the Aarong Craft Shops. Aarong helps sixty-five thousand rural artisans market and sell their handicrafts and has become the most popular handicraft marketing operation in Bangladesh. Using revenues from Aarong, BRAC began testing microfinance and primary education initiatives. When the oral rehydration campaign concluded in the 1990s, BRAC was ready to scale up its most successful microfinance and education programs.\n\nToday, BRAC's integrated health, finance, and education programs are active in 70,000 villages in all of the sixty-four districts of Bangladesh, reaching an estimated 75 percent of the entire population. Its health programs serve more than ninety-two million people, its microfinance programs assist more than seven million borrowers, and its education programs reach more than 1.5 million children.\n\n\nBuild Infrastructure First\nDespite the later successes of BRAC's social enterprises, Abed knew better than to dive immediately into the business of business. Instead, BRAC spent most of its first decade building its infrastructure, which now includes a training department, an evaluation department, an internal audit department, and a logistics department. \"My background in business and finance helped me understand the importance of having the right infrastructure and management systems,\" Abed explains. \"For example, from my work with Shell, I came to appreciate the importance of budgeting and monitoring, and I understood that BRAC needed to create a solid internal audit department and lay the necessary groundwork for running businesses.\"\n\nConsequently, BRAC weaned itself from donations very slowly. Established in 1974, BRAC still received all of its funding from donors in 1980. Eleven years later, BRAC generated only 3 percent of its total budget through social enterprises. Only twenty-five years after its founding was BRAC earning most of its funding through its businesses. \"Somewhat ironically,\" notes Abed, \"as we become less needy of donor funding we become even more attractive to donors.\"\n\nAs BRAC expands, it leans heavily on its organizational foundation. Take BRAC's training department, established in 1978 when the organization had fewer than three hundred staff members and revenues of less than $1 million. Over time, the training division became responsible for the professional development of all BRAC staff, fostering an entrepreneurial, business-oriented culture. For example, BRAC developed a middle-manager training program that teaches analytical skills and includes a social venture plan competition. BRAC has pursued numerous social venture ideas that arose out of this competition, such as a model high school. The organization currently devotes roughly 10 percent of its personnel budget to training. It also continually updates its programs, with recent offerings such as \"Management Skills and Effective Meetings.\"\n\n\"Many other nonprofits get trapped doing short-term program work and use a lot of short-term contract workers,\" says Abed. \"These nonprofits don't build their organizations to do bigger things. I decided early on that for BRAC to serve the nation and conduct successful social enterprise we needed to train people.\"\n\nBRAC's internal audit and financial monitoring department also smoothes the path for sustainable social enterprises. In 2007, for instance, the department conducted internal audits in over five thousand locations. When the department audited the microfinance program, it found that some branch managers were giving a second loan to clients who could not pay back their first loan. Because of this finding, BRAC computerized its entire microfinance program so that it could more closely monitor all of its loans and curtail ineffective practices.\n\nIn recent years, BRAC has expanded into Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. As was the case in Bangladesh, the organization is first building strong organizations and saving the launch of social enterprises for later. \"BRAC needs time to connect with the needs of the people in these countries,\" explains Abed. \"It takes at least five years of operating on the ground before it is possible to discern the needs of the people and to assess social enterprise opportunities.\"\n\n\nChoose Business Wisely\nHaving built a strong organization, BRAC next considered which businesses to pursue. The nonprofit was and remains very choosy about the types of businesses it launches, using three criteria to judge potential enterprises. First, the enterprise must align with the organization's mission to help lift people out of poverty with job training, income, capital, and improved health. Second, it must complement BRAC's existing programs. Finally, the business opportunity must meet a market need.\n\nIn 1990, for instance, BRAC began making microloans to poor women who wanted to raise milk cattle. But when Abed met with one of the program's borrowers, she revealed that she was having a hard time getting the milk to market, and that even when she could, she received only one-third of the price that milk sellers received in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital. So in 1998 BRAC established the BRAC Dairy, which primarily purchases and markets the milk that its microlendees produce. To collect and process the milk for the dairy, BRAC has set up eighty milk chilling centers across Bangladesh. The BRAC Dairy and milk collection centers employ more than five hundred people. In 2007, the project generated $1.15 million in surplus cash, which was enough not only to support the workers and dairy farmers, but also to expand operations. The BRAC Dairy is also becoming increasingly competitive with other Bangladeshi dairies: its market share increased from 20 percent in 2006 to 35 percent in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, BRAC discovered that its borrowers were not profiting much from their cattle  in part because the breeds of cattle to which they had access did not reliably produce much milk. To improve the breeds of livestock throughout Bangladesh, BRAC created an artificial insemination (AI) program in 1998. BRAC operates one bull station and a network of seventy storage facilities across the country, and trains more than a thousand AI workers. These workers not only deliver high-quality semen and inseminate cows, but also provide wrap-around services such as vaccination, pregnancy diagnosis, and calf delivery. BRAC pays the workers a fixed fee per insemination, which means that the more work the AI worker completes, the greater his income. BRAC's AI program generated $60,000 in profits in 2007. At the same time, it not only granted job skills and income to people across Bangladesh, but also supported the microentrepreneurs, dairy and chilling-center employees, and consumers  many of whom are also poor  further down the value chain.\n\nSimilarly, as part of its mission, BRAC wanted to improve teacher training and curricula in its network of more than fifty thousand one-room rural schools. The organization decided that high-speed Internet access was the best way to get information to teachers. Yet Bangladesh did not have nationwide high-speed coverage. So BRAC partnered with San Francisco-based gNet to create bracNet, which is building Bangladesh's high-speed network from scratch. As with other BRAC-run social enterprises, bracNet is expected to become a sustainable enterprise.\n\n\"At the most fundamental level, all of our social enterprises arise from the needs of our programs and our clients, and they typically address market failures,\" Abed says. \"Thus it would be impossible for us to develop an enterprise that did not align with our mission and program, because the starting point is always the mission and program.\"\n\n\nKnow When to Let Go\nBRAC is picky not only about which enterprises it starts, but also about which ones it keeps. In the late 1980s, the organization entered the motorized irrigation pump business. According to the business plan, groups of landless borrowers would take out BRAC microfinance loans to buy and operate the pumps, which they would then sell to farmers. The farmers, in turn, could use the pumps to water their crops during Bangladesh's winter dry season, when there is too little rain for farming most crops. By the winter of 1992, more than seven hundred BRAC pumps covered an estimated twenty-seven thousand acres.\n\nYet trouble was brewing: rice prices were falling, as were crop yields. Farmers couldn't pay back the pump salespeople, who in turn could not pay back their microloans. In 1996, Abed decided to shut the operation down. \"This was a project with far too many moving parts over which BRAC and the pump operators had insufficient control,\" writes Ian Smillie in a forthcoming book on BRAC. BRAC sold most of the pumps on the thriving private market. Then, using a cash reserve dedicated to the purpose, the organization refunded 100 percent of the payments that borrowers had made on their loans.\n\nAlthough BRAC has shut down most of its money-losing social enterprises, it sometimes preserves those that make outsized contributions to poverty alleviation. For example, some of BRAC's milk-chilling stations are not collecting enough milk to break even in the near term. Yet the organization keeps the stations open because they are located in extremely poor areas that would suffer greatly from the removal of access to fair prices.\n\n\nListen to the People\nThrough its many programs, BRAC has established a nationwide network of workers and clients who can guide the creation and management of new enterprises. Its health service alone employs seventy thousand community health volunteers across Bangladesh. BRAC constantly asks workers and clients to suggest ideas for new social enterprises, as well as to offer advice about how to improve established businesses and programs. Microfinance borrowers, for example, must attend a group meeting every week. At these meetings, BRAC staff members record borrowers' feedback and then deliver it to the larger organization.\n\nFeedback from the field is also a cornerstone of BRAC's monitoring and evaluation activities. For instance, BRAC regularly conducts focus groups as part of its program assessments. One such focus group led to the creation of BRAC's new Program for the Ultra-Poor, which currently serves more than a hundred and thirty thousand women. The focus group revealed that some of the poorest families in Bangladesh could not participate in BRAC's microfinance program because they did not have the wherewithal to borrow and repay.\n\n\"They needed grants rather than loans,\" says Abed. And so BRAC designed a program that would \"hold the hands\" of Bangladesh's poorest 10 percent by giving them grants and stipends for the first two years of their participation, he says. Then, most of the clients \"graduate,\" becoming full-fledged microfinance borrowers.\n\nBRAC combines listening to the people with thoroughly analyzing programs from the top down. Indeed, many consider BRAC to have the best evaluation approach of any nonprofit in the world. Its approach includes both internal program monitoring and external, independent auditing that reports to the audit department, rather than to program heads. This separation ensures that the external auditors' findings are independent of the programs'. In this way, conclusions about the various programs' outcomes and results are more likely to be accurate and unbiased because they are informed by separate, independent sources. This independence is critical in assessing performance, but most organizations do not enforce it.\n\n\nIs Business Your Business?\nMany Americans seem to think that social enterprise exists only in the United States. Yet for the past few decades one of the most successful nonprofit social enterprise organizations has been operating in Bangladesh. That organization, BRAC, shows that nonprofit organizations can launch social enterprises that work on a large scale.\n\nMuch of BRAC's success stems from the leadership and expertise of its founder. Recently, Abed has been recognized with several awards, including the 2007 Henry R. Kravis Prize in Leadership. More than thirty years ago, Abed envisioned an organization that would reach the poorest people in the farthest reaches of Bangladesh. His background in business helped him execute that vision. \"Often people are very skeptical of nonprofits running social enterprises, and with good reason: it requires two vastly different cultures coexisting side by side,\" says Abed. \"Our social enterprises are successful because we run them like businesses while at the same time staying focused on our nonprofit mission.\"\n\nNot all nonprofits are in a position to mix profits with programs, however. Organizations that are considering a revenue-generating business should take a hard look at their motivations, organizational cultures, and resources. Upon reflection, most will find that they should stick to more traditional fundraising, rather than pursuing moneymaking ventures.\n\nFor the few organizations ready for business, however, social enterprises can expand their reach, advance their missions, and deepen their capacity to innovate. BRAC's enterprises, for example, have allowed the organization to reach the poorest, most isolated villages in Bangladesh with novel, successful programs that address many different needs at once. They also give BRAC independence from donor funding. This financial independence is indeed very compelling, not only for organizations making their way in the nonprofit world but especially for the clients they serve.\n\nServing more than 110 million people per year, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee is the largest nonprofit in the world, but it doesn't receive the most charitable donations. Instead, BRAC's social enterprises generate 80 percent of its annual budget. These revenues have allowed the organization to develop, test, and replicate some of the world's most innovative anti-poverty programs....",

        "title":"The Best of Both Worlds",
        "content":"Why do some nonprofits endure and grow despite downturns in the economy? What do large, \"corporate\" nonprofits have that smaller organizations do not? Why, with all the business books on the best-seller lists, aren't more people using that knowledge to help nonprofits  which are themselves businesses in the sense that they hire people, recruit boards, provide products and services, operate facilities, and worry about revenues? And how can nonprofits reasonably expect to do what they've always done when nothing about the environment they're operating in is the same as it was ten, or even five, years ago?\n\nStill popular in the for-profit world, Jim Collins' Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies and Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't are empirical studies of American businesses that have endured and grown dynamically when compared to their competitors and the overall economy. Collins' studies are important because they dispel some longstanding myths, including the widely held belief that only businesses headed by a charismatic leader can be successful.\n\nReduced to a single concept, Built to Last argues that \"building the clock\"  the solid, self-rejuvenating structure of the organization itself  is the key to organizational sustainability. The examples Collins cites include some of the original \"learning\" organizations  companies striving to beat their competitors with cultures that institutionalize risk-taking and high expectations. Their leaders are willing to explore a range of options, understanding up front that not all will pan out but ready to move forward with those that do. They are never satisfied with their results, no matter how good, and constantly challenge themselves to improve. The organizations examined in Built to Last tolerate and reward \"smart\" mistakes  well-thought-through ideas that, for whatever reason, didn't produce the desired results.\n\nIn what started as a completely separate study, Collins' Good to Great demonstrates that organizations with passion, that understand and stay committed to their products and services, and that proactively manage their economic engine (i.e., keep a watchful eye on their sources of revenue) almost always grow faster than their peers. In the process, Collins shows that there are different levels of leadership and makes the case that enduring companies are characterized by leaders that model excellence in terms of business ethics, personal accountability, and commitment to the organization and its stakeholders. Likening the infrastructure of success to building and maintaining a flywheel, Good to Great depicts dynamically successful companies as organizations that nurture people who understand and embrace the concept of team ball, that establish internal management tools to identify problems before they get out of hand, and that willingly prioritize decisions for the greater organizational good.\n\nLike many successful for-profit management approaches, Built to Last and Good to Great offer lessons that, slightly modified, can be applied to the nonprofit world. To do so, however, requires nonprofit practitioners to overcome their historical distrust of terms and concepts such as \"customer,\" \"stakeholder,\" and \"marginal profit.\"\n\nHaving sat for more than twenty-five years at both nonprofit and for-profit planning tables, my experience is that success for any organization comes down to focus. Whether the vision and mission of the organization are front and center in the annual report or just a firmly held set of beliefs in the founder's mind, clear focus acts as a prioritizing mechanism. While in the for-profit world this mechanism generally takes the form of providing a competitive product or service to a group of customers with an interest in and the wherewithal to buy it, in nonprofit organizations it typically involves the cause or unmet need a nonprofit was created to address.\n\n\n\n\n  ...A sustainable nonprofit is one that learns to structure everything it does...around a single cause or unmet need....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Collins suggests in Built to Last, a sustainable nonprofit is one that learns to structure everything it does  from service delivery, to development, to volunteer coordination and client outreach  around that single cause or unmet need. By not allocating resources to unrelated or non-core activities and by not having to ask staff and volunteers to do more than is reasonable on a regular basis, it avoids the overextension that leads to burnout and chronic turnover. Nor do Built to Last nonprofits do things just because that's the way they've always been done, or because that's what the founder likes to see; they do things because they have been validated as the right thing to do for their customers (i.e., constituents). In the process, they also learn to do things like leverage primary and secondary research, conduct focus testing, and package programs for delivery using new distribution channels such as the Internet.\n\nEven more important, Built to Last nonprofits routinely step back and revalidate their vision and mission, evaluating their strategies against changing customer needs and technologies. At for-profit dynasties like GE, strategic planning is a constant process, an ongoing endeavor designed to ensure organizational cohesion and exceptional performance. Linking changes in the environment and economy to decisions about strategy, Built to Last nonprofits become adept at training their staff to understand how customer needs change over time and take pains to emphasize the importance of addressing those needs in the proper sequence.\n\nAs an example, let's take an agency that helps recovering alcoholics. Its public funding has been slashed, forcing it to cut its budget to the bone. In such a situation, delivering support for individuals seeking help, whether self-sought or through intervention, is the one thing the agency knows how to do that is most likely to lead to sobriety and lasting recovery for its clients. If the agency succeeds in attracting additional funds, it then must decide whether it should add family counseling or teach its clients the life skills they forgot or failed to develop when they were drinking. Put in these terms, it's easy to see that staying sober is more central to the organization's mission than helping clients' families understand the disease of alcoholism. Or is it? Built to Last organizations invariably make the right decision in such situations because they have mechanisms for understanding how to make tough choices based on their clients' needs.\n\nSimilarly, a Good to Great organization serving the same client base does what is necessary to motivate everyone in the organization in such a way that their passion for helping early recovery alcoholics achieve sobriety is renewed on a regular basis. Employing a combination of monetary and non-monetary incentives, it takes steps to ensure that its employees and volunteers retain and enhance their skills, keep up to date with the latest research and methods of treatment, and generally stay on top of changes in its client base. Finally, it proactively seeks out and develops additional funding sources to enable it to remain true to its mission while carefully weighing the need to make changes in its mission as circumstances demand.\n\nAnd foundations? Built to Last foundations stay in touch with the needs not only of their grantees, but of their grantees' constituents. They are willing to adapt their own longstanding funding areas and giving cycles to the cyclical demand for their grantees' services. Built to Last foundations recognize that in today's changed environment, one of the most important things they can do is to offer technical assistance and/or capacity-building grants to ensure that their grantees have the strategic planning resources and know-how they need to be successful over the long haul. And they understand that most nonprofits will never manage to create a viable business plan if they don't have the internal skills needed to do so.\n\nIn Chicago, the Sara Lee Foundation has taken a leadership role in this regard by supplementing its traditional grantmaking with a series of intensive \"Built to Last\" management workshops for nonprofits offered through the Donors Forum of Chicago. \"Many agencies have been forced to enter a new kind of strategic planning cycle,\" explains Barbara Kemmis, vice president of library services at the Donors Forum. \"There is a gap between what agencies need and the supply of funding to access it. There are no silver bullets; just hard work.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ...Foundations need to recognize that by strategically partnering with businesses and nonprofits, they can generate new synergies that improve desired results for all three....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations also need to recognize that by strategically partnering with businesses and nonprofits, they can generate new synergies that improve desired results for all three. Several years ago, when I was with the Ameritech Corporation, I created a national stakeholder team that served the collective needs of industry groups as well as consumers and businesses. In the process, we proved that, with forethought and planning, we could improve revenues for the company, provide new services for customers, and leverage foundation grants to help nonprofits improve the delivery of services to their constituents.\n\nAn example of this was a project our team undertook in the Hispanic community. Working with a nonprofit research group, we conducted a study to learn more about why Hispanics were underrepresented among Internet users. The study showed that not only was there a lack of knowledge about the Internet among young Hispanics, there was also a lack of access, even though Internet-enabled computers were available in most schools. We also learned that Hispanic families tended to gather in community centers. So we partnered with a PC provider that was willing to put computers in these centers and arranged to have Internet access donated; we also included introductory PC training in the package. The results were a pleasant surprise. Our sales to Hispanics  not just in Internet offerings, but in other areas as well  increased, while our public perception in the Hispanic community improved noticeably. More importantly, through the effort we were actually able to contribute something of value.\n\nWhen modified to address the realities of the nonprofit sector, for-profit tools like those defined in Collins' two books, as well as other successful management practices such as Six Sigma, Management by Objective, and executive and leadership development training, can offer smart lessons to mission-driven organizations at a fraction of the ultimate cost of sticking to business as usual.\n\nParticularly when the demand for nonprofit services is likely to grow for the foreseeable future, it's time to visualize and act on a value exchange involving the best of the business and nonprofit worlds. Nonprofits, passionate and entrepreneurial by nature, fully understand how to get by on less. For-profits, crunched as never before by global competition, fully understand how to cut waste through the application of technology and cutting-edge customer-relationship practices.\n\n\n\n\n  ...The potential for a new, hybrid business model exists....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential for a new, hybrid business model exists. Like the revolution that eBay unleashed on the consumer-to-consumer marketplace, combining the best of both sectors, for-profit and nonprofit, could be just what society needs, feeding for-profit employee needs for more altruism in their lives, while giving nonprofits greater access to in-kind services from businesses and placing strategic partnerships in a whole new light.\n\nImagine a world where corporations and corporate foundations go a step further, becoming strategic partners with nonprofit organizations in funded value exchanges. A world in which they teach nonprofits how to create measurable performance objectives, or proactively match the skill sets of their employees with the specific management needs of a partner agency. In the process, they perform a valuable service, and the agency benefits by getting the skills transfer it needs but can't afford.\n\nSuch exchanges have the potential to leverage the best of both worlds to accomplish more than either could achieve on its own. It's a simple idea, but one whose time has come.\n\nWhy do some nonprofits endure and grow despite downturns in the economy? What do large, \"corporate\" nonprofits have that smaller organizations do not? Why, with all the business books on the best-seller lists, aren't more people using that knowledge to he",

        "content":"I'm determined to give NBC's new show, The Philanthropist, a fair chance. Sure, I've seen the first episodes. Did it perfectly reflect the reality of the majority of the philanthropists we represent or work with? Probably not. But I also can't help feeling that it was about time someone glamorized what I do for a living. Let's review the context:\n\nThe buzz for giving comes courtesy of a new TV show, in prime time, on a major network (NBC, Wednesdays, 10PM). Check.\n\nThe series title is unambiguous: The Philanthropist. Good. No missing the point there. Check.\n\nThen things would appear to get a bit tricky. The Entertainment Weekly logline for the premiere praised the series, but also called it a drama about a \"rich, rule-breaking, risk-taker\" who's also a \"reckless billionaire.\" Well, as Caroline Preston wrote in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, this is not exactly \"the stuff that fills many annual reports on corporate giving, to be sure.\"\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in recent pop culture history, a depiction of someone who calls himself a philanthropist (until recently, one of the most boring words in our language to most people), will have a chance to enter our homes and make us all aware of the need for the truly-lived, philanthropy-centered life. That in itself is a big accomplishment.\n\nMoreover, the namesake of the series will also get a chance to spark conversation, to generate dialogue about giving and about the ways our giving is changing along with us. In the twenty-five years since Hispanics in Philanthropy's creation, no other event has had the potential to create such a wide-ranging, potentially long-spanning, intimate, entertainment-integrated and, so, emotionally driven reaction, and that is one big deal.\n\nAnd there's more. The series protagonist, like Bobby Sager, the real-life philanthropist it's based on, is a former businessman who brings his business skills to bear on his philanthropy. Well, check and check! That's what HIP is has always been all about: sound business practices for effective philanthropy.\n\nActually, it's what we, all of us in the philanthropy world, are all about. How else could we continue to do so much in the current economic climate? By leveraging! Like Bobby Sager, and \"Teddy Rist,\" we look at philanthropy as a vital part of life, something enriching to be done for its own good. We're globe-trotters, or would like to be, because we believe in transnational connections. We know it's about getting close to people, understanding things from all points of view. Sager himself says that he often gives abroad because the dollars go further, and like any good businessman, he's looking for \"exceptional return on investment.\" (We, at HIP, like to mix things up a little, investing both in the United States and Latin America, but the point is well-taken.)\n\nHe says he gets to \"deploy the same kind of skills I used to make money...make people accountable\" and he likes to make it sustainable to \"give it legs.\" Well, check, check, and check. What else do philanthropists of all budgets do year in and year out?\n\nSo you'll understand if, in the end, I don't care too much if this philanthropist gets a little reckless in his over-the-top, 007-like pursuit of making the world a better place. How else would I keep from forgetting the difference between my non-glamorous life's work, and the fictional entertainment of a TV series?\n\nOh, yes. There is the detail of Bob Sager having an actual submarine hatch as the entrance to his office. I wonder if one can get one of those on eBay.\n\nDiane Campoamor is president of Hispanics in Philanthropy, which is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this year. Prior to joining HIP, Campoamor served as a director at the Shalan Foundation, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (MALDEF), the United Way, and the YWCA.\n\nI'm determined to give NBC's new show, The Philanthropist,a fair chance. Sure, I've seen the first episodes. Did it perfectly reflect the reality of the majority of the philanthropists we represent or work with? Probably not....",

        "title":"Accountability and the Sustainable Nonprofit",
        "content":"In my home state, the Maryland Association of Nonprofits recently announced that their voluntary \"standards for excellence\" program is going national. That's a good sign. The program requires participating organizations to fill a five-inch-thick binder with documentation about their governing, financial management, and fundraising practices. Organizations that demonstrate their compliance with the program's standards are given permission to use the association's seal of excellence in their materials and on their Web sites. My own organization has engaged in the process with gusto, and such programs are gaining popularity as the nonprofit sector faces a growing chorus of voices demanding greater accountability.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThis is the first in a series of three articles by Richard C. Harwood that explores the 3 A's of Public Life:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability  Setting realistic expectations for change and pursing actions that have meaning for people.\n\n\n\nAuthority  Possessing knowledge rooted in the community and infusing that knowledge throughout your work.\n\n\n\nAuthenticity  Reflecting the reality of people's lives in your words and actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, they form a set of touchstones for the practices necessary to create greater sustainability in nonprofit organizations and their work.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut creating organizations that are not only accountable but able to sustain themselves involves more than complying with a set of standards, however well intentioned, and displaying a \"Good Housekeeping\" seal. It demands a fundamental shift in how nonprofit leaders view accountability. If we are to avoid taking our organizations down the wrong path, we need to pursue an accounting of ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately, discussions about accountability usually focus on external forces and internal procedures. Many of us persevere through detailed checklists to determine whether our organizations are meeting various standards of accountability: Are we fulfilling the goals of our funders? Does our organization meet particular financial-management standards? Is our board structured properly? These and other efforts are vitally important for any nonprofit that strives to be both successful and sustainable. But they do not make up the whole of accountability.\n\n\n\n\n  ...A significant piece of accountability must come from within each of us.....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA significant piece of accountability must come from within each of us. Each of us must ask, \"What promises have I made to people? What claims can I make about my work? Does it have integrity? What about my organization? Is it truly and consistently serving the public good  and if not, why not?\" Asking such fundamental questions helps nonprofit leaders to focus on what they can realistically achieve in their work. It reminds them of their responsibility to the communities they serve. And it's a powerful way to reveal an organization's capacity to create change and encourage each member of the organization to examine his or her own personal capacity.\n\nUltimately, we are all in the business of change. But what are the implications of accounting for ourselves? I believe there are four important factors about which we must be forever conscious: the rhythms of community life; definitions of progress versus success; notions of time; and legacy. Of course, there are other factors. But these four affect every change effort, even though they may sometimes be forgotten or hidden among more common measures of accountability. When we are aware of these factors, we invariably make our efforts more sustainable because we become more accountable  to both our community and ourselves.\n\n\nFactor #1: Rhythms\nI use the word rhythms to refer to the stages of a community's life. My own organization, in a report entitled Community Rhythms, has found that there are five key stages in a community's life: the Waiting Place, Impasse, Catalytic, Growth, and Sustain/Renew. Many efforts designed to bring about change are based on the assumption that the community in question is in the \"growth\" stage  a stage characterized by respected leaders, strong networks, positive norms, and civic-minded organizations.\n\nBut most communities are not in the \"growth\" stage; they're in an earlier stage where their capacity for change is much less developed. As a result, change in these communities often plays out in all-too-familiar fashion: An organization will announce a new program to great fanfare. It gives the program three years to produce change. When, after three years, people begin to realize that the promised change has not materialized, disappointment sets in and people lose hope. Those in charge are chided and told to try harder. It may seem like farce, but something resembling it happens more often than you'd think.\n\nEfforts that assume that networks already exist which can jump-start and sustain change in a given community, or even that there exists among the people in that community a commonly held idea of a path for change, are almost certainly doomed to failure. Honest assessments of what is possible in a community begin with an honest appraisal of the stage from which that community is starting down the path of change. A community's passage through the five stages can be accelerated, but the stages themselves cannot be ignored or skipped.\n\n\nFactor #2: Progress vs. Success\nAccounting for ourselves also requires being aware of another tension: progress versus success. This has to do with our conception of outcomes and what it means to move forward and generate change. I have consistently found in all kinds of organizations  whether foundations, civic groups, or nonprofits  that the working assumption concerning outcomes is one of success. In other words, either you hit the mark or you don't. In reality, of course, none of us can do our work in this way, nor will any community ever make significant progress if this is the prevailing paradigm. Saddling ourselves with an all-or-nothing idea of success blinds us to the steps we must take on the path toward real change, as well as the knowledge that we stand to gain along the way.\n\n\n\n\n  ...Saddling ourselves with an all-or-nothing idea of success blinds us to the steps we must take on the path toward real change....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn place of the idea of success as a hit-or-miss affair, we should instead consider our aspirations  not wishful dreams or a wild vision, but what we truly hope to achieve through our efforts. What are the milestones that will help us understand whether or not we are moving toward that goal? I once had the opportunity to work in South Carolina with school and community leaders from four of the lowest-performing districts in the state who were looking for ways to improve their local schools. I asked them to identify what they wanted to achieve in seeking such improvements. One of the goals they mentioned was the desire to turn their local schools into the \"highest performing\" schools in the state over the next three years.\n\nBut they also described for me the context in which they hoped to achieve this goal: Many of the school buildings in the four districts were dilapidated; many parents never showed up for teacher-parent conferences; kids went to school hungry and undernourished. They told me their communities did not value education, that through ways big and small they were signaling to the children in those communities that attending school wasn't important. Given the conditions they described, I asked myself:\n\n\n\n\n\nRealistically, how fast might change come about in these communities?\n\n\n\nWhat, if any, building blocks for change are already in place?\n\n\n\nWhat might give people in these communities a sense of possibility and hope to sustain their efforts, especially when the going gets tough?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ...When people inflate their expectations, they end up accomplishing less than they could have by adopting a more realistic view of the situation....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have found that when people inflate their expectations, they end up accomplishing less than they could have by adopting a more realistic view of the situation. They overreach and over-promise and, in doing so, end up undermining their efforts. In the worst cases, they distort what needs to be done, when, and by whom  and end up producing very little. It seems to me a moral imperative to avoid this approach. Every child is entitled to a quality education. The question is, what steps have to be taken in order to deliver on that promise? Grand plans and lofty rhetoric must be checked against real results. We must constantly look at ourselves and ask whether the actions we are taking are right and necessary. Doing so puts us in a position to become more, not less, accountable for making progress and helps us to sustain our efforts over time.\n\n\nFactor #3: Time\nAll this talk about change underscores the need for us to think about time differently. The notion of time  its literal playing out  is an acute challenge to all of us, whether in our day-to-day work or in our personal lives. In our society people tend to adopt a stopwatch mentality, an approach that can drive them to feel overworked and personally stretched. Every thing we do is a race against time. This same dynamic can push us to design programs and pursue goals that we know are unattainable but which sound good, position us well, and/or help us to raise needed dollars. Then we  and others  wonder why so many people are skeptical, or even cynical, about efforts undertaken in the name of the public good.\n\nIn similar fashion, the very expectations that the public, funders, colleagues, and others impose on us can be downright onerous. It often seems as if people engaged in change efforts are expected to solve the most vexing public dilemmas overnight. Funding for organizations expires just when programs have been ramped up and are beginning to gain traction. My own organization has found itself in this situation a number of times, and our experience is not unique. Money becomes a proxy for time.\n\n\n\n\n  ...a blind allegiance to the stopwatch is not only unhealthy, it's dangerous....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of us assume that because we are consumed by the demands of time, we are accountable to them as well. And in some ways we are. None of us can escape the realities of our day-to-day existence. But a blind allegiance to the stopwatch is not only unhealthy, it's dangerous: The essence of time  how things really unfold and what it takes to be part of a larger cycle of change  totally escapes us.\n\n\nFactor #4: Legacy\nThe idea of a larger cycle of change leads me to my last point: the notion of legacy. What do we want to leave behind as a result of our work? Often, the talk of legacy, if it is broached at all, is a matter of personal gain  how to position oneself in a field or embellish one's results. Such talk often is found in annual reports.\n\nLess often do we think about legacy in ways that place ourselves and our work in a larger context. The simple fact is, there have always been people who were willing to wrestle with the issues with which we wrestle, and there will always be people who follow in our footsteps and work to address the same issues that engage us today.\n\nThe notion of legacy embodies the other three factors I have mentioned. In order to have a sense of a community's rhythms, you have to be willing to see the work that has come before. Your progress  and what you hope will be the lasting impact of your work  must be viewed in the larger context of what is possible. An appreciation of one's legacy also helps to put time in the proper perspective, placing your work within the unfolding and neverending story of a community.\n\n\nThe Challenge of Leadership\nUltimately, the challenge of accountability is a challenge of leadership. And leadership requires two qualities that are enormously important but often difficult to integrate into our lives: courage and humility. Courage enables those who possess it to step forward and ask the questions that need to be asked, to hold themselves accountable for their promises, actions, and the progress that they are, or are not, making in their work. Humility requires us to acknowledge that we do not have all the answers  we are neither the first nor will be the last to take on the work we do  and that real change takes longer than the limited time we are usually able to devote to a project.\n\nSo, what is a true \"seal of excellence\"? The good work of the Maryland Association of Nonprofits is part of it. But there's another part, one that often is obfuscated in our rush to be seen as being accountable. That part is much harder to quantify. We must account for ourselves, something that requires each of us to exercise constant vigilance and sensitivity. It is a promise we should all make and try our best to keep. If we can keep that promise, we may even find a new path to sustainability for our organizations and the work they do. There is no better time to begin than now.\n\nIn this week's column, Richard C. Harwood, founder and president of the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, examines the relationship between personal accountability and sustainability....",

        "title":"Volunteering to Change the World",
        "content":"How do you change the world? The Points of Light Instituteand Hasbrobelieve that the best way to do it is through empowering the youngest generation. The reason is simple: Youth volunteers help make our world a better place to live today and give us all hope for the possibilities of tomorrow.\n\nAt the Points of Light Institute we believe in tapping into the power of people through service. At the core of this theory of change is our conviction that supporting the participation of young people in volunteering and service is critical to building a society of educated, engaged citizens. To that end, this month we launched a new global movement to inspire and empower kids to discover that they are never too young to make their mark on the world. We call this movement generationOn.\n\nWe know that kids genuinely want to help, and we also know that the biggest challenge they have faced to date has been a lack of access to volunteer opportunities. generationOn is a platform for all youth service and community organizations to work together and help kids discover their potential through the transformative power of service. Through projects that identify and address community needs, volunteer service that brings together diverse groups of young people for a common cause, and leadership opportunities that link civic awareness with the transition to adulthood, the initiative aims to provide millions of children with the tools they need to get involved. And thanks to a generous grant from the Hasbro Children's Fund, these projects and this vision finally have the resources needed to gain a foothold in communities across the U.S. and around the globe.\n\nBut challenges remain. How do we reach a generation of kids that learned how to text as soon as they could spell? How do we engage kids who are struggling in school to go the extra mile for others in their communities? How do we motivate all kids to take action? By starting early, by making service cool, and by doing our best to integrate it into the curriculum.\n\nWhen we ask a young person to serve, we change how she views her role in the world. The simple act of asking sends a child the message that the world needs her, and that her voices and actions count. As an advocate for early exposure and engagement of children in volunteer activities, generationOn is changing the way volunteer agencies view the importance of young people in their programs. We would never delay in teaching our children math or how to read, so why wait to teach them about community, service, and their potential to change the world for the better?\n\ngenerationOn offers programs for kids starting as early as the preschool years, when kids are modeling positive behaviors learned from their parents. For years, research has shown that empathy and concern for others are two of the most important outcomes of service-learning, particularly when introduced in early childhood. (Interestingly, lack of empathy has been shown to be a characteristic of many young people who end up in the juvenile justice system.) Yet service as a graduation requirement typically has been limited to private high schools. So while teaching kids to \"do good\" may sound simple, it's serious business, and we believe it can be part of the solution for reaching today's at-risk youth.\n\nWhat's truly unique about generationOn, however, is that we are building an organization that puts kids first. To that end, we're partnering with Hasbro and the HUB, organizations that are expert in reaching kids and getting them excited about new trends, ideas, and activities. Young people want to help and they have the creativity, ingenuity, and energy to tackle real-world issues. If we add the means and give them opportunities to imagine a better world, we give them HOPE. And that, in turn, will give us hope that the next generation is better equipped to tackle and solve the big problems we and our parents have failed to address.\n\nWhether organizing a neighborhood walk to inspire healthy living, fundraising to purchase thousands of energy-efficient light bulbs, or raising their voices for educational reform, generationOn youth are making their mark on the world. Recently, in conjunction with Kids Care Weekand Make A Difference Day, members of the Baldwin Rockets Kids Care Club in Manassas, Virginia, led their entire 600-student elementary school student body in promoting drug prevention and \"planting character,\" with each student planting a red tulip bulb in front of the school to signify their pledge to stay drug free. Members of the club also organized additional planting and a clean-up effort in the community park next to their school, a place known to local law enforcement as an area where drugs are sold.\n\nOf course, starting a \"movement\" is not just about reaching a single audience. We've got to reach all kids, wherever they may be, through their families and in their schools. generationOn programs connect students to what's going on in the world. Through service, kids are able to apply the lessons they learn in the classroom to the real world. Those lessons are particularly poignant in communities struggling with high dropout, poverty, and crime rates, and where citizens too often are seen as mere recipients of service. generationOn teaches kids that they are not powerless or helpless. And that's what makes our projects so valuable. They're not just about volunteer action; they're about the shift in perspective that comes with understanding that each and every one of us matters.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's what volunteering is all about and what generationOn seeks to provide to all kids: the chance to make a difference in their communities and help change the world around them for the better. Won't you join us?\n\nMichelle Nunn is the CEO of Points of Light Institute and co-founder of Hands On Network, the main business unit within the institute.\n\nAt the Points of Light Institute we believe in tapping into the power of people through service.

        "content":"Before Dan Rather stepped down as anchor of the CBS Evening News, capping an impressive though at times controversial career, he told Ken Auletta of the New Yorker how he wanted to be remembered. \"The one thing I hope and I believe,\" said Rather, \"is that even my enemies think I'm authentic.\"\n\nBut what does it mean to be authentic? After all, the word is invoked so often these days one can't help but wonder what constitutes authenticity, especially in a society that works so hard to manufacture it.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThis is the final article in a series of three by Richard C. Harwood that explores the 3 A's of Public Life:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability  Setting realistic expectations for change and pursing actions that have meaning for people.\n\n\n\nAuthority  Possessing knowledge rooted in the community and infusing that knowledge throughout your work.\n\n\n\nAuthenticity  Reflecting the reality of people's lives in your words and actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, they form a set of touchstones for the practices necessary to create greater sustainability in nonprofit organizations and their work.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue that dogged Rather in his final months as anchor of the Evening News was the inauthentic documents he used for a 60 Minutes report on President Bush's National Guard service  this despite the fact that Rather had labored mightily throughout his long career to be authentic, generating in the process a whole collection of \"Ratherisms,\" homespun sayings such as the one about the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan's opponent for the U.S. Senate, who, said Rather, had \"about as much business in this race as a moose in a phone booth.\"\n\nAlthough the veteran newsman's quaint phrases struck a chord with some viewers, former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite recently commented that his successor in the anchor's chair \"gave the impression of playing a role.\" Authenticity often is confused with a kind of posturing designed to foster goodwill and trust. Yet, as Rather's case teaches us, such efforts ultimately ring hollow and produce little more than cynicism in people.\n\n\n\n\n  ...authenticity emerged as a key factor in determining whether leaders were able to muster credibility and trust....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a shame, because the importance of authenticity in our society cannot be overestimated. In practically every effort the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation has undertaken during the past seventeen years  whether our focus was the improvement of journalism and politics, working with foundations and community-based organizations to improve their effectiveness, or attempts to address specific public challenges such as education or the environment  authenticity, or lack thereof, emerged as a key factor in determining whether leaders and organizations were able to muster the credibility and trust necessary to bring about sustainable change.\n\n\nThe Need for Authenticity\nThere is, I believe, a crisis of authenticity in society today. It stems in large part from the belief among citizens that the reality of their lives is not reflected in the stories covered by the news media, in the rhetoric and action of their leaders, or in the initiatives undertaken by the nonprofit sector.\n\nOver a decade ago, my organization released Meaningful Chaos, a report that examined how people form relationships with public concerns. One of the report's most significant findings was that people formed attachments to such concerns when they felt that three standards of authenticity were being met. The standards went far beyond people merely insisting that their own personal prejudices be reaffirmed by what they saw, read, or heard:\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople want discussions of public concerns to reflect a base sense of reality  the context of their lives, what is at issue for them and society, their daily language  something that current news coverage and public discourse often fail to do;\n\n\n\nPeople want information sources to reflect an understanding of their experiences and values  and yet such experiences and values are often dismissed as \"soft,\" \"irrelevant,\" or \"unreliable\" in today's strategic and highly competitive world;\n\n\n\nPeople want to be given the story straight  they want to be squared with  but such candor is increasingly rare in public life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the years since we published the study, I have experienced time and again just how frustrated people are because their sense of reality is not accurately reflected in so much of what passes for public life; more to the point, too often their sense of reality is distorted by leaders and organizations primarily interested in advancing their own agendas.\n\nI am now in the process of finishing a book, Hope Unraveled, that traces the changing relationship of citizens to politics and public life over the past fifteen years. The book reveals, in essence, the story of people's retreat from the public realm. There's an old country song whose refrain goes, \"I can't see me in your eyes anymore.\" That's how people feel when then look at public life  they cannot see or hear themselves. The fact that people are turning away from politics should not come as a surprise; that people are also retreating from their own communities and, in some cases, even from their own neighbors should. And the consequences of that are real and sobering.\n\nIf people once gave leaders the benefit of the doubt on public matters, now they want those leaders to prove the worthiness of their causes and actions before they will believe them. That kind of show-me attitude can have a corrosive effect on society, leading people to question at every turn the veracity of public statements and endeavors, and to personally waver in their own commitment to the public good.\n\n\n\n\n  ...If people once gave leaders the benefit of the doubt, now they want those leaders to prove the worthiness of their causes and actions....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen one purchases a collectable or antique, it is often accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. These flimsy sheets of paper, and our faith in the person who provides them, give us some comfort that we are acquiring something that is authentic. But there are no such certificates for public-sector organizations or leaders. Instead, it is up to each of us to earn such authenticity in the eyes of those with whom we work and serve.\n\n\nMore Than Words\nOne oft-used technique in the pursuit of authenticity is to manipulate words to create a simulated connection with people or to conjure up an appearance that hides or disguises reality.\n\nTake local news organizations, which routinely try to establish a connection with viewers by adopting taglines such as \"On Your Side!\" or \"We're Connected to You!\" These approaches inevitably ring hollow, as people come to realize that the final product fails to deliver on the slogan's promise. I have been in scores of newsrooms where the marketing department has created a new tagline only to have the news-gathering operation maintain the status quo - a status quo rooted in a presentation that rarely reflects the real issues with which people must grapple.\n\nSimilarly, how many times have you visited a community in which banners adorning streetlights proclaim, \"We're Back!\" And yet, if you were to walk down Main Street and interview people, how many people would tell you a different truth? This kind of manufactured authenticity not only makes people wary of communications efforts in general, it also reinforces people's ingrained reflex to discount the host of messages they hear and see in the public realm. Messages become interpreted as efforts to manipulate, with honest, forthright communication the ultimate victim.\n\nHere's another example. Short funding cycles, not to mention the shrinking pool of available funding, often produce the temptation within nonprofit organizations to overstate success. Each of us has probably found ourselves in a situation where we stretch the facts, embellish results, and toot our own horns, all in the hopes of securing the next dollar or a funder's approval. Deep in our hearts, we know that such an approach is antithetical to true authenticity. But because we've been conditioned to believe that short-term results can be produced by pursuing such a path, we do it anyway.\n\n\nFalling Back on Expertise\nAnother tactic used to increase authenticity is to appropriate expert opinion and jargon as a way to convince others that we understand an issue and have a solution. But this can backfire, too.\n\nIn the Harwood Institute's on-the-ground projects and research on public school reform, we've often had people tell us that they don't understand the public school debate, let alone engage in it. Why? Because leaders engaged in the debate  whether researchers, professional educators, or politicians  tend to resort to professionalized language that leaves people feeling cold and excluded, as if public discussions about schools were wholly unrelated to the education of children. The same scenario plays out on a multitude of issues every single day.\n\nThe response of a woman in Indianapolis whom we interviewed for a nationwide study is quite revealing. When asked about the use of professional language in public life, she said, \"I think first, you shoot all the experts.\" When asked to elaborate, she explained, \"They have a whole language, and it has a lot of letters in it, and I don't know what those letters are, and they have a lot of these things they talk about, and normal people don't understand that.\"\n\nIn an effort to stem the use of expert language, some initiatives now appropriate what I would call \"public language.\" One familiar example is the reliance on the phrase \"town hall meeting.\" All sorts of organizations now sponsor town halls as a way to signal to people that their voices will be heard and that the sponsoring organization cares  a code word signifying authenticity  about them.\n\nBut how many town halls have you seen or attended that amount to nothing more than \"tell and sell\" sessions in which a panel of so-called experts on stage speaks at people? Or where people line up behind a microphone for their one minute of discourse? Or where people actually do talk to each other, but where their opinions and insights are not substantively integrated into a program's design and implementation? To care about something means to give it your serious attention. But if we do not give serious attention to the voices and perspectives that people bring to a town hall meeting, we surely will deepen their cynicism about public life, causing them to retreat further from any effort that tries to engage them. Ultimately, our actions speak much louder than our words.\n\n\nThe Whole Story\nFrom my earliest discussions with people about authenticity in public life, the theme that has surfaced most consistently is the sense people have that they are not being squared with and are receiving only part of the story. Certainly this theme comes through loud and clear when people are referring to political leaders and news media coverage of politics; but it is present, too, when people talk about nonprofits and nonprofit leaders.\n\n\n\n\n  ...the theme that surfaces most consistently is the sense people have that they are not being squared with....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Spinning\" public events has become commonplace in our society, to the point where a new definition of the word has entered our vocabulary. In the Harwood Public Leadership School, participants read a case study on how a nonprofit leader should respond to a public event that has the potential to adversely affect the organization. Time and again, session participants' reflex is to \"spin\" a response to the news reporter who calls asking for a comment. And yet, upon further reflection, most participants say that their initial response would compromise their authenticity in the eyes of their constituents and community.\n\nOne well-known cable news anchor calls his program the \"no-spin zone,\" even though his program is largely about spin. He's not alone, of course. I remember reading a news article in the Washington Post during the 2004 presidential campaign that showed how the two major candidates had taken different facts about the economy and twisted them to present different meanings, even though both sets of facts (as the article pointed out) were true. But the candidates were not interested in the \"truth\"  only in using parts of it to pursue their own political agendas. By now, we have all become familiar with the damaging effect such inauthentic efforts have on people's trust and confidence in political leaders, politics, and public life.\n\nCloser to home, a similar effect can be seen in the way our municipal officials, education professionals, and business leaders talk about the revitalization of our communities, the state of our public education system, or the health of the environment. For most people, authenticity only enters the equation when they are treated to the \"whole story\"  when, for example, a politician or public official says, \"This is the deal, and this is what I believe we should do.\" Then, and only then, are people able to understand the context of the discussion and the reasons being offered for moving in a certain direction. Then, and only then, can people judge for themselves what needs to be done. Then, and only then, will people trust their leaders, even when they disagree with them.\n\nIn one of our studies, a woman from Little Rock described what she needed to hear from a leader in order to credit that person with greater authenticity:\n\n\"If [a leader] would admit that the country was in bad shape....And if he got the facts from people, rather than from his advisors...and if he came out here and said, 'Ok, we've all discussed it, I have listened, and this is what I think we should do. And we're going to do it'  then I would pay attention. Otherwise, I'm out of here.\"\n\n\"Out of here\"  that is what so many people have said, through words and actions, about their relationship to public life and politics. The sense of authenticity is simply missing. To be authentic means to care; to care suggests one holds a kind of affection for something or someone. If we could re-develop our affection for public life, we would make sure our actions were truly authentic. We would hold ourselves to a higher standard. And we would walk away from certain activities that might look good on paper but which we know fail any reasonable test of authenticity.\n\n\nThe Path to Authenticity\nDan Rather's authenticity can and will be debated for some time. But in the meantime, I am reminded of his most famous signoff. For many years during his career, and at the close of his final broadcast, Rather concluded with the simple declaration, \"Courage.\"\n\n\n\n\n  ...To be authentic means to care; to care suggests one holds a kind of affection for something or someone....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourage, as I have noted in previous articles in this series, is an essential part of the kind of public leadership I am proposing. In these articles I have focused on what I call the 3A's  authority, accountability, and authenticity  all of which require public leaders to summon the courage to stand up and declare their intentions to build a stronger, more vibrant, more sustainable public sphere. Such declarations will no doubt be met with resistance from those who want quick solutions and easy answers. No matter; the people doing the building must persevere.\n\nAlong with courage, leaders must approach the public with a good deal of humility. Humility teaches us that we do not have all the answers, that we must actively engage others and learn to listen, and that the solutions to problems we propose may need to change as we learn more over time. It is nearly impossible to exercise courage without humility, for how else would we know what to do and say?\n\nOver the last generation or so, too many people's hopes with regard to public life and politics have come unraveled. If we are to re-engage people in public life, ensure that our own efforts are effective and sustainable, and restore hope in our politics and public life, it is essential that we make authenticity a touchstone in all our efforts. At the end of the day, words and deeds count more than we know.\n\nIn his final article in a three-part series on the 3 A's of Public Life, Richard Harwood, founder and president of the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, argues that, without a restored sense of authenticity, the efforts of America's public- and pri",

        "title":"Breaking the Cycle of Poverty",
        "content":"Statistics about poverty in the United States are alarming. And given the recent history of intergenerational progress among the poor, foundations and philanthropists alike should be asking, \"Where's the impact?\" For fifty years, we've been investing in anti-poverty programs and initiatives. To what end? If we want to break the cycle of poverty, maybe it's time to re-think our investments.\n\nThis year, Boston Risingis launching with $15 million in seed money and a 100 percent focus on breaking intergenerational poverty in the Boston area. Having spent significant time considering the impact question and researching groundbreaking models with the greatest potential to move the needle, we have come to a conclusion. To break the intergenerational poverty cycle, we must invest in individual choice and control.\n\nAccording totheNew York Times, more people between the ages of 18 and 64 lived in poverty in 2009 than in any year since 1959. Underscoring the crisis, the Urban Institute notes that \"Being poor at birth is a strong predictor of future poverty status. Thirty-one percent of white children and 69 percent of black children who are poor at birth go on to spend at least half their childhoods living in poverty.\" Moreover, a childhood spent in poverty significantly raises one's odds for poor outcomes as an adult.\n\nOur collective idea of America includes the notion that it is a meritocracy. We tend to believe that our free-market system rewards those who help themselves, and that those who are willing to \"pull themselves up by the bootstraps\" can and will \"get ahead.\" This idea is accompanied by a pervasive cultural conviction that the poor are neither interested in nor willing to change their circumstances. (The top Google search result for \"generational poverty\" is a Wikipedia quote: \"One aspect of generational poverty is a learned helplessness that is passed from parents to children and on down the line.\") The data belie both ideas. Our meritocracy is broken. The poor want to, can, and typically do work incredibly hard, but our systems don't give them the freedom to access or leverage the capacity, capital, and social connections the middle class take for granted. Some of the most interesting anti-poverty models in America today are changing that by putting resources, choice, and control directly in the poor's hands.\n\nConsider Lawrence Community Works(LCW) in Lawrence, Massachusetts. LCW is a place-based nonprofit organization that supports and is thriving in one of the poorest communities in the state. LCW describes what it does as \"building family and community assets\" and \"providing others with caring and mutual support.\" Its Neighbor Circlesmodel, widely copied around the Commonwealth, provides resources to families that self-organize a series of dinners as a way of building social capital and providing a forum for neighborhood participants to discover and act on common interests and concerns. In Lawrence alone, the program has led to forty community improvement projects driven entirely by residents.\n\nFor a national example, consider the Family Independence Initiative(FII), whose leader and founder, Maurice Lim Miller, was appointed in December 2010 to President Obama's Council for Community Solutions. Miller launched FII in California after twenty years of toiling in the poverty industry. FII bases its model on the idea that \"most low-income families are capable of taking tangible steps toward establishing control and choice in their lives.\" As the organization's Web site notes, \"The common thread is that people turn to family and friends, pool resources, and follow the example of those in their inner circle who have begun to succeed.\"\n\nThe results? In 2007, FII's initial cohort in San Francisco saw a 20 percent improvement in income and a 70 percent improvement in their kids' grades in just fifteen months. Indeed, the success of these sixteen families led two hundred other families in the area to express interest in the program. Today, FII is active in three states and is helping to shape national policy vis-a-vis support for poor communities.\n\nBoth of these models, as well as interesting initiatives in Tulsa, Pittsburgh, and other communities, turn the usual assumptions on their head. All start with the idea that the poor, when given opportunities to create and engage with meaningful social networks, can and do work hard, will build and leverage assets, and will do more than anyone or anything to change their own circumstances. It is an approach that invests in and expands both connection-building and individuals', families' and communities' own resources, rather than one-size-fits-all top-down prescriptions.\n\nWe at Boston Rising strongly believe in and have begun to invest in this approach. Our goal is to create a new relationship between philanthropy and poverty by pairing this empowering investment approach with new forms of Internet-based giving and activism that also increase donors' choice and control. Indeed, we believe the combination of these two ideas can and will help direct philanthropy toward lower-cost, scalable poverty-fighting models that truly leverage the power and potential of the poor themselves.\n\nWe believe we have arrived at a crossroads in the fight against poverty, and we hope others, over time, will join us.\n\nTiziana Dearing is CEO of Boston Rising, a startup fund and grantmaking organization that supports individuals, families, and communities as they chart their own paths out of poverty.\n\nStatistics about poverty in the United States are alarming.

These discussions usually focus on such topics as jobs and the economy, public schools and family life, the news media and politics. In almost every one of them, I ask people to name leaders they would trust to stand up and give them an honest assessment of an important issue. More often than not, the silence I hear in response is deafening. Only a handful of people are able or willing to name leaders, on any level of society, that they trust. Indeed, in a fit of desperation, one person in a recent conversation said that actor Keanu Reeves was as good a name as any.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \nThis is the second in a series of three articles by Richard C. Harwood that explores the 3 A's of Public Life:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability  Setting realistic expectations for change and pursing actions that have meaning for people.\n\n\n\nAuthority  Possessing knowledge rooted in the community and infusing that knowledge throughout your work.\n\n\n\nAuthenticity  Reflecting the reality of people's lives in your words and actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, they form a set of touchstones for the practices necessary to create greater sustainability in nonprofit organizations and their work.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so much work to do in our communities and the nation as a whole, the problem, as many people see it, is that our leaders too often are focused on maintaining their own power, pursuing a narrow agenda, or relying on a superficial understanding of people and their concerns. In fact, I find that people increasingly believe the same thing to be true of business leaders, religious leaders, and, importantly, nonprofit leaders.\n\nAt a time when one can no longer simply claim authority but must earn it, how can we as individuals and leaders of organizations speak, act, and ultimately lead with authority?\n\n\nSpeaking with Authority\nFor many people, speaking with authority means citing various \"experts\" or making data-driven decisions. I remember being told in class in graduate school that the best way to solve a public problem or create change was simply to get people with the right pedigree around a table. The idea, apparently, was that the \"best and the brightest\" automatically hold authority. For others, it involves raising the volume of a discussion  demanding change or yelling at people to secure adherence to a particular plan.\n\n\n\n\n  ...In order to possess real authority, you must first possess a deep understanding of the community you hope to serve....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, neither of these approaches is a guarantee of the authority necessary to work in real communities  or to ignite people's imaginations in a meaningful way. In order to possess that kind of authority, you must first possess a deep understanding of the community you hope to serve.\n\nWhenever I address the issue of authority, I always find myself posing the same test: If you were dropped into a room full of people from a community, could you talk to them about their concerns, about their aspirations and the obstacles they face in achieving them, about what they value? More importantly, would they believe you? Would they hear their concerns and voices echoed in your words and sentiments?\n\nThere is, of course, the temptation to skip, sidestep, or at the very least minimize any effort to gain a deeper understanding of the communities we serve. We make excuses, saying it will take too much time or too many resources. Or, we assuage our guilt for not making the effort by conducting quickie surveys, indulging in short-hand assumptions, or focusing on hot-button issues, before setting off to devise our own solutions to the problems we have identified through such means.\n\nYet another temptation is to believe you can gain a deep understanding of a community as a passive observer. A few years ago, when I had a job teaching reporters how to connect with the communities they were covering, the managing editor of one of the nation's largest newspapers told me he would never just drop one of his reporters into an unfamiliar neighborhood because, as he put it, \"They wouldn't know what to do!\" Consider for a moment a reporter who is assigned to cover the impact of a homeless shelter on a neighborhood. That reporter might talk to the director of the shelter, interview a few people in the area for the \"man on the street\" perspective, make a few calls to public officials, and then write his story. Indeed, it's quite possible he might not even visit the shelter. A story written in that fashion would get some of the facts right, but it wouldn't get all the right facts, and it almost certainly would miss the larger context  the history of the shelter in the community, the perspectives of neighborhood leaders, the attitudes of local residents toward the shelter, or of the people who will use the shelter.\n\nIf we in the nonprofit sector hope to create sustained change, we cannot fall into such traps. Instead, we must make an effort to understand how people talk about, and seek to make sense of, the dilemmas in their lives. And in doing so, we must heed their personal stories, experiences, and even their use of language to gain context, meaning, and perspective. In short: we must view ourselves as operating as part of the community, rather than apart from it.\n\nUndertaking this vital work is necessary not simply because we want to produce a compelling report, have a grant renewed, or even to say that we \"listened.\" It's necessary because a deep understanding of the communities in which we work helps to ensure that our work reflects the reality of those communities and that our responses to that reality are potent and meaningful.\n\nConsider another example. During the recent presidential contest, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, made headlines during an all-important campaign stop in Wisconsin by calling the home of the Green Bay Packers \"Lambert,\" instead of Lambeau, Field. On one level, this verbal miscue may seem too insignificant to raise here, perhaps even silly; but anyone who knows Wisconsin knows that Lambeau Field is one of the most revered places in the state. If Senator Kerry could not properly pronounce its name, how, the people of Wisconsin must have wondered, can we expect him to understand our concerns about health care or education? In that moment, Senator Kerry's authority was greatly diminished.\n\nWhen people in a community seek out leaders with genuine authority, they look for individuals who have a deep understanding of their concerns, a sense of their values, and are crystal clear about the tradeoffs they are willing to make to bring about change. On the flip side, those who seek to claim authority in that community must be absolutely familiar with its sense of itself. They must be familiar with the type of civic places that exist in the community, the people who use those spaces, the conversations that take place in them  and the stories and insights that emerge there. Those who seek authority must also be attentive to the kinds of language people use and how people describe their concerns as well as their aspirations. And one more thing: they must be aware of their own biases and preconceived notions with respect to that community.\n\nWithout this knowledge  without knowing the communities in which we work as well as we know the back of our own hands  we cannot expect to claim authority in our work. And yet gaining the knowledge to speak with authority is only the first step. We must also summon the discipline to actively use that knowledge to make our efforts more effective and sustainable.\n\n\nActing with Authority\nThe essence of acting with authority is acquiring knowledge and then putting it to work. We must infuse everything we do with such knowledge. That infusion must take place on an organizational level, so that we can leverage the mission and resources of our organization for change; and at the personal level, as a way of holding us accountable for our own words and deeds.\n\n\n\n\n  ...The essence of acting with authority is acquiring knowledge and then putting it to work....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted, many programs fall short of their goals and objectives because they fail to achieve this lofty ideal. At times our efforts may be based on superficial, incomplete, or downright erroneous knowledge of a community. This can occur because we fool ourselves into believing that our efforts to gain knowledge have been meaningful and/or pursued in good faith. I once was involved with a project in a major metropolitan area. The group sponsoring the project was told by its funders that they needed to get more \"input\" from the public in order to have more credibility  more authority  in the eyes of the community. During a conference call one day, the project managers ran down the options under consideration. The first involved putting a three-question survey online that would allow anyone who visited the project's Web site to \"participate\" in the project. The second involved setting up a \"talk box\" downtown through which passersby could offer their own thirty-second opinion about the project. But my favorite was option number three: a reality-show-type contest in which residents would compete for a spot on the project's advisory board. Now there's an idea!\n\nUnfortunately, as ridiculous as Survivor: Philanthropy may sound, I encounter such ideas every day. And they all have one thing in common: They're informed by misguided notions of what constitutes, and what it means to exercise, authority.\n\nSuch stories remind us that the activities we pursue within our organizations and through our individual leadership  in meetings and conference calls, conversations and decisions, planning sessions and program design  shape the very essence of our work and reflect the sense of purpose with which we conduct that work. Recently at the Harwood Institute we have been involved in developing a tool for public agencies that benchmarks their external efforts with respect to acquiring public knowledge and then helps them evaluate their internal efforts to apply that knowledge.\n\nTaking this step toward true authority is not easy, and organizations of all kinds struggle with it. But as you work to gain a deeper understanding of the communities in which you work, there are questions you can ask to ensure that your organization is acting with authority rooted in that knowledge:\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we absolutely clear about the hopes, aspirations, concerns, and values that prevail in the community we hope to serve?\n\n\n\nDo we have the capacities  time, skills, internal mechanisms  to stay the course?\n\n\n\nDo we consistently use the knowledge we gain from the community to inform our best judgments?\n\n\n\nDo I have the personal fortitude to follow through on applying the knowledge we've gained  especially as people within the organization resist such a path, complain that it is unimportant, or simply do not see its relevance?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my first article in this series, I wrote about the importance of being accountable to the rhythms of community life. Knowledge of a community can help you identify those rhythms. And if you understand those rhythms  if you're interested in working with them  you will be able to better determine the kinds of strategic interventions and changes that are possible in the near term, as well as those that may take longer to evolve. Such an understanding is a key step toward acting with authority. But even that is not enough.\n\n\nLeading with Authority\nThe kind of authority I am proposing requires that each of us approach the community in which we work from the inside out, rather than from the outside in. We must view ourselves as part of the community, and ask ourselves what that means for our relationship to the community. In part, it means that we must see ourselves as being interdependent with the community. That in order to figure out our appropriate role in society and make informed judgments about our actions, we must develop a deep understanding of the communities in which we work. Otherwise, we may find ourselves operating in a dangerous vacuum.\n\n\n\n\n  ...The kind of authority I am proposing requires that each of us approach the community in which we work from the inside out....\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not suggesting that expert knowledge is unimportant or not to be tapped. Just the opposite. In all of my research and experience with on-the-ground projects, I have found that ordinary people believe deeply in the professional roles of school teachers, journalists, health care professionals, nonprofit leaders, and other experts. They do not wish to usurp the place of professionals, even though it sometimes appears that way. What people want is to be more than just spectators in a community that has become a playing field for professionals; they seek instead an ongoing relationship with those professionals. True authority derives from this sort of give-and-take between a deep understanding of the community and one's own professional expertise and judgment.\n\nAs with accountability, I return again to courage and humility  virtues far too rare in public life today. To operate with true authority, nonprofits must have the courage to change their relationship to the communities in which they work and to apply that approach to everything they do. Taking into account a deeper understanding of a community  and possibly changing your own way of thinking  also requires courage, as does putting your stake in the ground and saying, \"This is where we are, and this is what we need to do to move forward.\"\n\nAlong with courage we must find humility, for I have yet to see real courage exercised without it. Humility  the humility to say we do not have all the answers  is essential if we are to open ourselves up to listen, learn, and share space with others. And, if we are truly humble, there will even be times when we realize that we have put our stake in the wrong place.\n\nIt is my hope that sometime in that not-too-distant future, I will ask a group of people to give me the names of leaders they trust and instead of silence I'll be greeted by a flurry of names of worthy individuals, all of whom wield true authority. For this to happen, however, all of us need to reexamine the work we do and how we exercise our own power and leadership. Only through such renewed leadership can we hope to imbue our work and organizations with lasting sustainability. And only then can we make haste with the unfinished work that remains to be done.\n\nIn the second in a series of three articles, Richard C. Harwood, founder and president of the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, examines how knowledge rooted in the community can enhance the credibility and effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.",

        "title":"The Greening of Wal-Mart",
        "content":"In 1989, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. launched one of the first major retail campaigns to sell environmentally safe products in recyclable or biodegradable packaging. The corporation promoted these eco-friendly products by labeling them with green-colored shelf tags. Although the company boasted more than 300 green products at its peak, it did not directly set or monitor the environmental standards of its suppliers. This resulted in negative publicity for Wal-Mart when the public learned that a green-labeled brand of paper towels had only a recycled tube  the towels themselves were unrecycled paper treated with chlorine bleach. The green tag program began to wane, and by the mid-1990s environmental issues seemed to have slipped off the company's list of priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Wal-Mart's reputation among consumers was also slipping. Issues surrounding its competitive practices and labor policies loomed large in the public eye. \"The company's environmental record was nothing to boast about, either,\" according to one Fortune article. Indeed, a 2005 McKinsey & Company study found that between 2 percent and 8 percent of consumers had stopped shopping at Wal-Mart because of the company's practices.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Wal-Mart CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. unveiled a new plan to reduce the company's environmental footprint. In an October 2005 speech broadcast to all 1.6 million employees in all 6,000-plus stores and shared with some 60,000 suppliers worldwide, he announced that Wal-Mart was initiating a sweeping \"business sustainability strategy.\" The idea was to reduce the company's impact on the environment through a commitment to three ambitious goals: \"To be supplied 100 percent by renewable energy; to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain our resources and the environment.\"\n\nBut these weren't the plan's only goals. \"Sustainability represents the biggest business opportunity of the 21st century,\" says Jib Ellison, founder of Blu Skye Sustainability Consulting, which helped Wal-Mart formulate its business sustainability strategy. His firm pointed out that actively pursuing an environmental agenda would help Wal-Mart differentiate itself from its competition, maintain a license to grow, and make its supply chain dramatically more efficient. In other words, a good business sustainability plan would help Wal-Mart get even better at what it does best: drive down costs to generate profits.\n\nTo go green, Wal-Mart, with its headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., would have to think outside the \"Bentonville Bubble.\" For years, the company had operated in relative isolation from its external stakeholders, including nonprofits, government agencies, consultancies, and academic institutions. Without much in-house expertise on sustainability and environmental performance, it would need to involve these stakeholders in its new plan.\n\nMoreover, as the paper towel incident illustrated, most opportunities for environmental improvements resided with suppliers. \"If we had focused on just our own operations, we would have limited ourselves to 10 percent of our effect on the environment and eliminated 90 percent of the opportunity that's out there,\" says Tyler Elm, who was Wal-Mart's senior director of corporate strategy and business sustainability at the time the initiative was launched.\n\nAnd so Wal-Mart began to reach out to its external stakeholders. The corporation first identified areas of maximum environmental impact and then invited stakeholders to join 14 \"sustainable value networks\"  such as the seafood network and the packaging network  to work toward business and environmental sustainability in each area. (See \"Wal-Mart's Sustainable Value Networks,\" above.) In return, network participants would gain information about and say in Wal-Mart's operations.\n\nElm and Andrew Ruben, Wal-Mart's vice president of corporate strategy and business sustainability, directed Wal-Mart's network leaders to \"derive economic benefits from improved environmental and social outcomes,\" says Elm. \"It's not philanthropy,\" he adds. By the end of the sustainability strategy's first year, the network teams had generated savings that were roughly equal to the profits generated by several Wal-Mart Supercenters, Ruben and Elm report.\n\nAfter interviewing more than 40 representatives from Wal-Mart and its network partners, we have uncovered seven practices that help the networks work for the environment, for stakeholders, and for the company's bottom line. Four of these practices extend Wal-Mart's own managerial capabilities through the expertise and involvement of its network partners; the other three help motivate suppliers. To illustrate these practices, we explore three different networks in depth: seafood, textiles, and electronics. These examples also highlight some possible shortcomings of Wal-Mart's approach.\n\nCertified Seafood\n\nIn 2006, Science published a study predicting that all species of wild seafood would collapse within 50 years. That same year, Wal-Mart's seafood business grew roughly 25 percent, to approximately $750 million. \"I am already having a hard time getting supply,\" says Peter Redmond, vice president for seafood and deli and captain of the Wal-Mart seafood network. \"If we add 250 stores a year, imagine how hard it will be in five years!\"\n\nContinuity of supply is the greatest challenge for Wal-Mart's seafood network, explains Redmond. One way Wal-Mart could prevent further depletion of fish stocks while ensuring its continuity of supply is to buy fish that has been caught and processed using sustainable fishing practices. Rather than defining new standards for certifying sustainable practices, Redmond understood the advantages of tapping into a well-defined third-party certification program.\n\nBy partnering with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), which managed the leading program in the field, Wal-Mart would avoid criticism that its standards were not stringent enough while leveraging the established expertise of the MSC and its partners. Tapping into a successful program would also help the company achieve results faster than working alone.\n\nThrough this partnership, the MSC, which Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched in 1997, maintains the standards for sustainable fisheries and certifies independent third parties to audit and accredit fisheries and processors throughout the supply chain. An MSC eco-label signals to shoppers that the fish has been harvested and processed in a sustainable manner from \"boat to plate.\" By raising consumer awareness, MSC hopes to stimulate demand and thus motivate the industry to shift to more sustainable fishing practices.\n\nWal-Mart, in turn, commits to working with MSC-certified suppliers, giving suppliers an incentive to seek certification  a time-consuming and expensive process. In 2006, Wal-Mart announced a highly ambitious goal to carry 100 percent MSC-certified wild-caught fish in its stores within three to five years. As the supply of MSC-certified fish is currently far from adequate to meet Wal-Mart's demand, this public announcement was effectively a commitment to buy from all fisheries that become MSC-certified.\n\nThe WWF plays another integral role in the partnership by helping boat operators and processors prepare for certification by identifying problems that need to be fixed (e.g., strengthening management practices, rebuilding stocks, and reducing environmental impacts) before they can be certified. This activity helps fisheries become certified more quickly to keep pace with the sharp increase in demand for certified seafood.\n\nAnother benefit of certification is that it establishes a clear view of each fish's chain of custody. \"One of the problems we had was how much of our fish was coming to us third-, fourth-, or even fifth-hand,\" says Redmond. \"Sometimes our supplier turned out to be nothing more than a packer who was going out to a market saying, 'I need 50,000 lbs. of salmon no matter where it comes from.'\"\n\nGreater transparency in the seafood supply chain allows Wal-Mart to select better suppliers, simplify the chain of custody, minimize paperwork, reduce transaction and transportation costs, and improve the quality of the fish it receives  all while improving environmental outcomes.\n\nThe nonprofits in Wal-Mart's seafood network win, too: Both the MSC and WWF are attracting suppliers who might otherwise have eschewed certification to capture or keep Wal-Mart's business. And their programs have gained unprecedented levels of visibility through Wal-Mart's involvement. This visibility helps them build clout with consumers and get other retailers interested in carrying more sustainable seafood.\n\nTrustworthy Textiles\n\nUnlike seafood, cotton is not in short supply. Yet farming conventional cotton creates millions of tons of pollution every year. In contrast, organic cotton farming is gentler on the environment and on farmworkers' health.\n\nWith labels that appeal to parents by emphasizing the softness and chemical-free nature of organic cotton, Wal-Mart has generated strong sales of organic cotton baby clothes  among other products. Wal-Mart customers are typically unwilling to pay extra simply because a product is better for the environment. When customers think that a product is better for their own or their family's health, however, they're more likely to dig deeper in their pockets to pay for it.\n\nBoth Wal-Mart and its customers initially had to pay more for organic cotton. Beth Schommer, a former Wal-Mart divisional merchandise manager for infants and toddlers, describes the pricing strategy when the program first started: \"A little organic shorts set was maybe $10.94, whereas a similar non-organic outfit would have been priced at $6.94. So, yes, there was a price premium compared to other Wal-Mart products. But when you consider a $10.94 organic shorts set out there in the marketplace, that's not expensive.\"\n\nNevertheless, to bring prices closer to those of conventional cotton, Wal-Mart is attempting to expand its organic cotton business. Nonprofits and government agencies are playing a significant role in this effort. To select and uphold certification standards for organic cotton farming and manufacturing, Wal-Mart's textile network partnered with the Organic Trade Association and Organic Exchange. These groups helped convince the company to adopt the U.S. Department of Agriculture's standards for the growth of organic cotton  regardless of where the cotton is grown. They also advocated use of the Global Organic Textiles Standard for processing. \"This is probably the toughest standard out there in the industry for organic processing and handling, and [now] it's the only certification process that can be followed for organic products coming to Wal-Mart,\" says Kim Brandner, senior brand manager of sustainable textiles for Wal-Mart.\n\nBy using external standards and accredited third-party organizations to certify practices at each link in the supply chain, Wal-Mart can guarantee that its products are, indeed, organic. The company can also minimize criticism that its involvement will dilute the stringent measures that organic products must meet (a concern raised by organic farmers, retailers, and NGOs alike). In addition, relying on network partners allows the company to accomplish its objectives without major investment because suppliers absorb most of the costs of certification.\n\nLike the seafood supply chain, the textile network has become more efficient with the advent of certification. \"It used to be that if Wal-Mart was buying Champion T-shirts, [it] wouldn't look past Sara Lee [which held the license for Champion products]. [It] didn't think about the spinner, or the dyer, the ginner, or the farmer,\" says Diana Rothschild, a former Wal-Mart employee and Blu Skye consultant to the textiles network.\n\nBut now Wal-Mart is forging ties much further up the stream of its supply chain to become more efficient and to reduce costs. \"We used to buy cotton from Turkey, ship it to China for spinning and knitting, and then ship it again to Guatemala to be cut and sewn,\" explains Brandner. \"Now...we're finding opportunities to do things like eliminate the shipment to China and have all processing done in Guatemala.\" Going directly to Guatemala not only saves time and money for Wal-Mart, but also further reduces the company's impact on the environment by lessening the amount of fuel and other resources used in shipping.\n\nWal-Mart is also cultivating closer relationships with its suppliers. Previously, textile buyers selected manufacturers on the basis of the cost and quality of their products. As a result, relationships with suppliers tended to be transactional and short-lived. Now Wal-Mart employees interact with more suppliers, more often, more directly, and for a greater duration than ever before. These closer relationships are necessary to sustain initiatives like the organic cotton project.\n\nA major transformation within Wal-Mart has made it easier to have closer relationships with suppliers. In the past, textile buyers had been generalists, handling a variety of responsibilities. Now the textiles network divides the buyer role into four different job categories so that some buyers are dedicated to maintaining long-term relationships with suppliers. These employees are encouraged to hold their positions for many years, as opposed to the 12- to 18-month rotations that Wal-Mart buyers typically complete. According to Brandner, these organizational changes, backed by the company's focus on sustainability, have not only supported the objectives of the textile network, but also led the team to ask better questions. \"It's helping us become smarter merchants,\" he says.\n\nAnother way that Wal-Mart is using its network is to build bridges between suppliers and environmental nonprofit organizations. For instance, when the Chinese government threatened to shut down a number of textile dye houses in Beijing, including one of Wal-Mart's suppliers, to reduce pollution in time for the 2008 Olympics, Wal-Mart immediately took action. \"We put the dye house in touch with one of the NGOs in our network, which helped it formulate a more environmentally friendly process that reduced its toxic output very quickly,\" says Brandner. \"Although other retailers were negatively affected by the shutdown of their Chinese dye suppliers, we did not have any of our production capacity cut with this vendor.\"\n\nTo boost supplies of organic cotton and help more farmers make the transition from conventional to organic farming, Wal-Mart has begun making longer-term commitments. For example, rather than working season to season, as the company has done in the past, it made a five-year commitment to buy organic cotton from a group of farmers. \"It gives them confidence and stability,\" says Lucy Cindric, senior vice president and general merchandise manager of Wal-Mart's ladies wear division and captain of the textiles network.\n\nThe company is also helping farmers manage some of organic farming's challenges. \"Organic farmers can't grow cotton in the same field for an extended time because it depletes the soil of nutrients,\" explains Rothschild. This forces farmers to alternate cotton with legumes, vegetables, and other crops to rejuvenate the soil. To meet organic standards, however, farmers must grow their alternate crops organically. Because alternate crops are not as lucrative as organic cotton, \"this creates the temptation for farmers to turn to nonorganic farming,\" she says. To help solve this problem, Wal-Mart agreed to purchase some of the organic cotton farmers' alternate crops  an initiative that was synergistic with the efforts of the company's sustainable value network focused on food and agriculture.\n\nEco-Friendly Electronics\n\nIn 2004, the United States exported 80 percent of its electronic waste to developing countries, where the waste led to pollution levels hundreds of thousands of times higher than those allowed in developed countries. Despite this off-shoring of pollution, computers and other electronics still account for some 40 percent of the lead in U.S. landfills.\n\nOne of the objectives of Wal-Mart's electronics network is to reduce these environmental impacts by recycling or disposing of e-waste more safely, as well as by designing electronics that don't contain hazardous materials in the first place. Another objective is to increase the energy efficiency of its electronics. The network has encountered more challenges in managing e-waste because of the complexity of electronics design and sourcing, the difficulty of measuring the hazardous content of electronics, and the necessity of consumer behavior change to accomplish recycling and safe disposal of used electronics. In contrast, the network has more readily increased energy efficiency because this outcome is easier to measure and to market to consumers.\n\nThe sheer complexity of electronic products and the electronics supply chain makes certifying that they are free of hazardous materials costly and difficult. Most electronic products are made up of sophisticated components that are sourced through complicated, multilevel supply chains. In these supply chains, one set of suppliers sources raw materials, another set assembles those materials into components, yet another set aggregates these components into more complex parts, and so on. At each link in the supply chain, suppliers have technical expertise and proprietary information that Wal-Mart cannot access. When Wal-Mart cannot ensure that all components in a product are free of hazardous materials, the company cannot promote the product as eco-friendly to consumers.\n\nFor example, Wal-Mart wanted to be the first retailer in the United States to sell personal computers that complied with the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS). And so the retailer negotiated a deal with Toshiba to supply RoHS-compliant computers to Wal-Mart stores. In exchange for buying 12 weeks' worth of these computers (as opposed to making a typical four-week commitment), Wal-Mart procured the environmentally preferable PCs at no additional cost. Nevertheless, because the company had no way of guaranteeing that the computers did, in fact, meet RoHS standards, Wal-Mart decided to play it safe and not promote the computers' environmental benefits.\n\nAnother way to reduce e-waste is to encourage consumers to recycle their electronics. Yet recycling offers no immediate personal benefit to consumers, and instead requires additional cost and effort. Because changing consumer behavior without palpable benefits is extremely difficult, the electronics team has not gained much ground on the recycling front.\n\nIn the area of increasing energy efficiency, the electronics network has had more success  largely because Wal-Mart can easily test product performance. One organization that helped the retailer in this endeavor is the Green Electronics Council (GEC), a nonprofit that works with electronics manufacturers and other stakeholders to improve the environmental and social performance of electronic products.\n\nWith the GEC, Wal-Mart designed an Internet-based scorecard on which suppliers indicate how environmentally sustainable their products are. This scorecard includes measures of energy efficiency, durability, and end-of-life solutions. The GEC and Wal-Mart are also co-sponsoring a contest to design consumer electronics that excel on all of the scorecard's metrics. Wal-Mart will carry the winner's product in its U.S. stores.\n\nThe electronics network has learned that improving environmental performance depends not only on its network partners, but also on consumers. \"What's always been difficult is to figure out the things that you can start with that are relevant to...the business or ultimately the consumer,\" explains Ruben. For example, consumers care about phantom load [the amount of energy a product consumes when it is on but not in use] because reducing phantom load results in electricity cost savings. Conversely, although recycling may be the right thing to do, it does not directly benefit consumers.\n\nAs a result, Wal-Mart has partnered with the GEC and other members of its electronics network to focus on a relatively small, manageable set of metrics with important benefits for both consumers and the company. Of particular interest are measures that could help reduce costs or create new revenue streams for the company. For instance, if the metrics on the company's electronics scorecard encouraged suppliers to develop upgradable products, Wal-Mart could sell the upgrades while delaying the disposal of the more durable goods. Implementing these changes, however, would take some time to accomplish.\n\nA New Kind of Networking\n\nAt the heart of Wal-Mart's business sustainability strategy is a shift from generating value through price-based, transactional interactions toward generating value from longer-term, collaborative relationships with nonprofits, suppliers, and other external stakeholders. Through its sustainable value networks, Wal-Mart gains a whole-system perspective that helps the retailer find profitable ways to address environmental issues such as fishery depletion, climate change, and pollution. In exchange, nonprofit network members stand to make giant leaps toward their missions because of the scale of Wal-Mart's operations. And suppliers enjoy not only the stability that closer relationships with the retail giant brings, but also the assistance and guidance of Wal-Mart's nonprofit partners.\n\nAlthough Wal-Mart's sustainability strategy appears to be off to a promising start, the company must proceed carefully as it seeks to sustain and expand its network approach. First, Wal-Mart must carefully manage its partnerships to avoid increasing its costs. The company's reputation is on the line as it makes ambitious promises  for example, to sell only MSC-certified wild-caught fish. Because Wal-Mart is dependent on suppliers in its networks to fulfill those promises, suppliers may try to leverage their improved position of power to negotiate higher prices, particularly in times of scarcity. More dependent on longer-term relationships with fewer suppliers, Wal-Mart might also lose its ability to buy products from lower-cost sources. In addition, as its ties with nonprofit organizations deepen, Wal-Mart may face pressure to reduce its environmental impacts in ways that increase production costs.\n\nTo resist upward pressure on costs, Wal-Mart can become still more efficient. It can also continue to partner with nonprofits to develop and implement innovations. And in its relations with suppliers, it can keep prices for green products low by committing to purchase greater quantities on the front end, rather than paying price premiums on the open market.\n\nWal-Mart must also pay careful attention to the balance of green and conventional products in its stores. In the past, Wal-Mart narrowly focused on its customers' immediate desires when planning product assortments. Now the company is taking on the additional responsibility of offering eco-friendly products, as well as of educating customers about these green alternatives. At the same time that green products help attract new customers, they also cannibalize sales of conventional products.\n\nMoreover, with fewer suppliers from which to choose and more nonprofits offering their input, Wal-Mart might overlook opportunities to stock innovative or desirable products that are not necessarily green. For example, many nonprofit partners advocate against the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, which may have negative effects on human health. Yet some suppliers argue that the negative effects of PVC are unproven. They also say that customers demand the strength and flexibility that only PVC can provide.\n\nWal-Mart's job is to manage these tensions, weighing the demands of customers against the concerns of network partners. To offer a profitable mix that includes more green products, Wal-Mart can retire conventional products in favor of green alternatives, work with governments to test materials and provide toxicity data to consumers, and seek government incentives for green products.\n\nA final risk that Wal-Mart's sustainable value networks must proactively manage is losing its nonprofit partners. Because of the high numbers of nonprofits participating in the networks, individual groups may be unable to claim credit for a specific, measurable reduction in environmental impact.\n\nOver time, groups' inability to prove their impact may cause problems with fundraising, as donors increasingly demand performance data. And despite the current optimism about Wal-Mart's efforts, donors might gradually balk at paying for environmental programs that are profitable for Wal-Mart  especially because Wal-Mart pays some of its sustainability consultants but others work for nothing. And although unpaid nonprofit partners presumably retain more leverage to criticize and influence Wal-Mart, their donors may worry that this leverage will erode as the nonprofits' relationships with Wal-Mart deepen.\n\nEventually, problems with fundraising could cause environmental nonprofit organizations to withdraw from the networks. Wal-Mart might avoid this issue by relying less on paid environmental consultants and ensuring that each nonprofit partner can point to its own measurable contributions to sustainability. More than anything else, Wal-Mart's network approach must remain profitable if it is to be sustainable in the long run and achieve Scott's environmental goals.\n\nDespite a historically narrow focus on operational efficiency, growth, and profits, the world's largest retailer has widened its sights, building networks of employees, nonprofits, government agencies, and suppliers to \"green\" its supply chains. Here's how and why Wal-Mart is using a network approach to decrease its environmental footprint  and to increase its profitability....",

        "title":"Nonprofit Essentials: The Development Plan",
        "content":"As Linda Lysakowski reminds us in Nonprofit Essentials: The Development Plan, the creation of a development plan is a complex endeavor requiring strategic vision, team building and management skills, and a commitment to meeting objectives in a timely fashion. And while most nonprofit leaders realize their organizations would be better off if they had such a plan in place, many would be unable to tell you what a development plan looks like or how to implement one. Fortunately, Lysakowski's book demystifies the process, presenting the challenges one must be prepared to address to achieve fundraising success in a practical, no-nonsense manner.\n\nLysakowski begins her book by introducing the concept of organizational \"life cycles\" and argues that effective development planning often rests on an understanding of where in its life cycle a nonprofit organization is. Borrowing from the works of writers such as Carter McNamara (\"Basic Overview of Organizational Lifecycles\"), Richard L. Daft (Organizational Theory and Design), and Judith Sharken Simon (The Five Life Stages of Nonprofit Organizations), she asserts that, without a fundraising plan, newer development officers, and even seasoned professionals, \"can get caught up in the whims of board members and volunteers or the demands of their CEO.\" Moreover, the absence of such a plan makes \"it hard to assess success, and harder still to justify the development budget, including staff salaries or increased staff positions.\"\n\nSo what does a successful development program look like? According to Lysakowski, the key elements are:\n\n\n\n\n\nClear fundraising goals and objectives\n\n\n\nBoard commitment to and involvement with fundraising activities\n\n\n\nAdequate resources dedicated to the technology needs of fundraising staff\n\n\n\nThe ability of the organization to create community awareness and build relationships\n\n\n\nA diversity of funding streams coupled with a variety of fundraising techniques\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, a good development plan. But, as the reader learns in chapter three, \"Planning to Plan,\" you'll never get there without a clearly thought-out process to follow. That process, usually led by the organization's chief development officer, should begin with an assessment of the organization's past fundraising results and proceed to an analysis of its current fundraising capacity and future fundraising goals. Lysakowski recommends the much-feared SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis as a helpful exercise in this regard. But she cautions that any such analysis should involve the board and senior leadership of the organization, not just development staff.\n\nThroughout the book, Lysakowski provides a variety of practical tools designed to facilitate the planning process. These include a \"Philanthropic Profile Assessment Tool,\" which can be used to assess the fundraising capacity of your organization and its readiness to proceed with a development program; as well as a \"Development Audit,\" a check list that's especially helpful when working with consultants. She also provides a number of tips that can be used when assembling a development team, and clarifies (once and for all) the role(s) of the board, the CEO/executive director, the development director, volunteers, and consultants in meeting your organization's fundraising goals.\n\nAlong the way, the reader gains a true appreciation for the role of the development director, who must navigate a multitude of inputs, agendas, and personalities to arrive at a workable plan that makes everyone and happy  and yields results.\n\nThe book is full of charts, from charts that help you monitor the accountability of individual team or board members, to charts that help you chart your fundraising progress (or lack thereof), to charts that can be used to begin charting your future fundraising plans. If nothing else, they remind you that a good development plan is like a sea chart, without which the ship (and its crew) is unlikely to reach its destination. It is, as Lysakowski might say, the essential document, and the development director is the person whose experience, knowledge of the surrounding waters, and steady hand guides the ship safely to its destination. Or, as that great lover of the sea Joseph Conrad once said: \"To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.\"\n\nWith Nonprofit Essentials: The Development Plan by your side, fundraising success is sure to be your next port of call.\n\nThe Foundation Center's Luz Rodriguez reviews the guide for development officers by Lysakowski, president and CEO of the consulting firm Capital Venture, who demystifies the process of putting together a development plan....",

        "title":"The Case for Stakeholder Engagement",
        "content":"Springfield, Mass., the birthplace of basketball, was once a thriving manufacturing center producing everything from Indian motorcycles to Rolls-Royce sedans. But the wave of factory closings that began sweeping the United States in the later part of the 20th century has hit the city hard, and no one has suffered more than Springfield's children. In 2001, at least one-third of those younger than age 9 were living in poverty, 20 percent of babies were born to teenage mothers, and students regularly ranked among the lowest academic achievers in the state.\n\nFor the staff and board of the Irene E. & George A. Davis Foundation, a local grantmaker whose goal is to improve the lives of individuals and families in Springfield and surrounding Hampden County, the persistence of child poverty and related problems prompted a reassessment of their strategies and mission. \"There was a feeling on our part that we were giving out all this money, and so what?\" said Mary Walachy, the foundation's executive director.\n\nAt the same time that the grantmaker was reevaluating its role in the community, national researchers were producing compelling data on brain development and the payoffs that come from investments in early childhood education. \"All of a sudden, it became clear that maybe we could make more of a difference if we started earlier with these children,\" Walachy said.\n\nIt also became clear to Walachy and others that the foundation could not tackle this problem on its own. To have a chance of slowing and ultimately reversing the trends that were keeping so many Springfield children from achieving their true potential, the Davis Foundation needed to work with a wider range of community stakeholders  everyone from business leaders and childcare providers to doctors and parents. \"We knew that if we developed a plan on our own and presented it to the community, they would say to us, 'Who in the world do you think you are?'\" Walachy said.\n\nThe Davis Foundation's belief that it would get better results by engaging directly with the community was the catalyst for its decision in 2001 to launch Cherish Every Child, an initiative that enlisted hundreds of Springfield residents and dozens of organizations in a collaborative process to create a plan to improve the health, education, and social and emotional needs of children age 5 and younger.\n\nAlthough improving the lives of Springfield's children will take time, Cherish Every Child has already shown results. For example, more families of newborns are participating in home visits where they receive information about such topics as child literacy and nutrition, and more children are receiving dental care, thanks to a newfound understanding of the connection between oral health and overall child well-being. In the last two years the Davis Foundation's $489,000 in grants leveraged an additional $1,054,000 from other sources.\n\nEqually important, more Springfield residents and organizations now recognize that children's welfare is a critical issue. Bill Ward, executive director of the Regional Employment Board of Hampden County (a nonprofit established by federal and state legislation as the primary workforce development agency in the county), was involved in Cherish Every Child from the start. Ward said his organization had never paid much attention to early childhood issues. Now, however, his organization has been given $500,000 by the state of Massachusetts to create a program to develop the professional skills of early childhood providers in Hampden County. It is also leading a five-year initiative to improve and expand the delivery of literacy services in Springfield. \"We now see early education and literacy as workforce development issues in a way that we didn't in the past,\" Ward said.\n\nThis article explores the experiences of the Davis Foundation and other grantmakers as they work more closely with important stakeholders, and the benefits that this engagement brings to grantmakers, grantees, and the communities they both serve. We at Grantmakers for Effective Organizations (GEO) believe that it is vital for grantmakers to be more engaged with stakeholders when grappling with complex social issues. The benefits that come from engagement are many, including developing a deeper understanding of social problems, creating new and better solutions, and building more effective organizations.\n\nGrantmakers Reluctant to Engage Stakeholders\n\nThere are countless examples of grantmaking initiatives that have failed to deliver the results they promised. When grantmakers get together to explore what went wrong, they often arrive at a common explanation: grantmaking initiatives are more likely to fail to the degree that they do not engage grantees and other stakeholders in identifying problems and designing solutions.\n\nAn example of this problem was the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's 10-year, $20 million Neighborhood Improvement Initiative. Intended to improve the standard of living in three San Francisco Bay Area communities, the effort fell disappointingly short of expectations. The Hewlett Foundation commissioned two independent researchers to take a critical look at the foundation's assumptions and methods and to identify lessons that could be learned. Among the researchers' central findings: the grantmaker did not do enough to develop \"healthy, trustful relationships\" among all stakeholders, especially neighborhood residents.\n\nThe report concluded: \"[T]he degree to which foundations and local groups can introduce new ideas to each other and debate their merits depends to a great extent on the amount of respect and trust in their relationship, as well as the extent of resident engagement and ownership....As community organizing efforts have shown, it takes sustained effort, explicit strategies, and opportunities to develop and exercise leadership to fully tap the resources that residents possess.\"\n\nIn spite of well-publicized failures like the Hewlett Foundation's, grantmakers still do not do enough to engage grantees, community residents, and other important stakeholders. In GEO's 2008 survey of the attitudes and practices of staffed grantmaking foundations in the United States, we found that only 54 percent indicated that it is \"very important\" for effective grantmaking that their organizations solicit outside advice. A similar proportion (52 percent) said it is \"very important\" to collaborate with external groups and organizations. These findings are encouraging, but the fact that half of foundations do not see these practices as very important is cause for concern.\n\nEven among the foundations that do show an understanding of the importance of engaging others in their work, there remains a gap between aspirations and actions. Only 36 percent of grantmakers seek advice from a grantee advisory committee about policies, priorities, practices, or program areas. Indeed, just 36 percent of all grantmakers took even the most minimal step of soliciting feedback (anonymous or non-anonymous) from grantees through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. The good news is that of those who solicited feedback, 97 percent reported that they have made changes based on what they learned.\n\nThese survey findings echo a common lament GEO heard from nonprofit leaders in the course of our Change Agent Project, designed in partnership with Interaction Institute for Social Change (IISC). In focus groups and interviews conducted in 2005 and 2006, nonprofit leaders told us that grantmakers don't pay attention to their voices or those of community residents in the planning and development of philanthropic policies and programs. A typical comment made by a nonprofit leader in one of the focus groups was the following: \"Intelligent people in philanthropy are disconnected from what's really going on in our communities, on the streets.\"\n\nGrantees aren't the only people who feel they are not working in common cause with grantmakers. According to polling conducted by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for the Philanthropy Awareness Initiative, influential community leaders show a limited understanding of the work of foundations; 85 percent could not give an example of a foundation benefiting their community. These survey results affirm a common complaint  that too often grantmakers work in an ivory tower, isolated from the communities they serve.\n\nWhy don't grantmakers engage grantees and other stakeholders? One reason is tradition. Philanthropic institutions historically have made grantmaking decisions from inside their own walls, and then handed those decisions down, in many cases reflecting a charity orientation to their giving. Adding to the problem, grantees are reluctant to give foundations honest feedback for fear of losing their current or possible future funding. This can lead to a power imbalance between foundations and those they support.\n\nWhen grantmakers do try to engage grantees and other stakeholders, the efforts sometimes fail. On occasion, a foundation doesn't get the right people involved at the right time. Other times, there is too much distrust among the people and organizations involved, so that they are unable to work together effectively. In some instances, the foundation already has decided on a strategy before telling the community what the strategy is. In many cases, the foundation's strategy relies too heavily on academic models and not enough on genuine input from the people working on the ground.\n\nWhat Engagement Looks Like\n\nPoliticians, businesses, and entertainment stars increasingly are adopting unconventional, non-hierarchical approaches, like Facebook and Twitter, to engage their constituents, customers, and fans. Philanthropists, meanwhile, have largely remained on the sidelines, sticking with top-down ways of interacting with their grantees and the communities they serve. Instead of staying with their traditional approach, grantmakers need to follow the lead of others who understand that good things happen when you reach out and involve people in your work.\n\nIn their outreach, grantmakers must go beyond the usual suspects  business leaders, academics, and paid consultants  to develop a more fine-tuned sense of what is happening inside the communities and the organizations that are touched by a foundation's work. Among the stakeholders that philanthropy most desperately needs to engage are nonprofit leaders (including leaders of grantee organizations and nonprofits that are not funded by the foundation) and community residents whose lives and neighborhoods are or will be affected by the foundation's work.\n\nThe Cherish Every Child project, for example, made a point of directly engaging these audiences from the start. Working with IISC and early childhood education expert Margaret Blood, the Davis Foundation convened a core group of more than fifty people from Springfield and Hampden County for a series of planning meetings in 2001 and 2002. Participants included parents of young children, community organization leaders, and representatives of the government, business, health care, human services, and education fields. The planning group's work was enhanced by focus groups with Springfield residents, along with meetings with state legislators and leaders from business and academia. Even young children were engaged through visioning exercises conducted at neighborhood summer fairs.\n\nSome foundations reduce the power imbalance between philanthropy and the communities they serve by handing over control of grants to others. The fifteen members of the Funding Exchange, for example, recruit activists to sit on community funding boards that make decisions on behalf of the foundations. Grants from the Liberty Hill Foundation's Queer Youth Fund are made on the basis of decisions by community activists. And the Cleveland Foundation's Neighborhood Connections program makes grants each year to local nonprofits based on the decisions of a panel of twenty-five Cleveland residents.\n\nOther foundations encourage stakeholder engagement by hiring people with direct community experience to work at the foundation. GEO's research shows that when foundations hire staff with nonprofit experience, they are more likely to engage in practices that make nonprofits more effective. Foundations whose staff has nonprofit experience are more than twice as likely to provide funds for grantee capacity building as ones that don't. These foundations also are three times more likely to support leadership development activities.\n\nAn important benefit of getting more stakeholders involved in a foundation's grantmaking decisions is that it gives people a better sense of how philanthropy works. But the main reason many grantmakers engage stakeholders in the process is the expertise they bring. \"Having people from the community involved helps the foundation because it leads to better grantmaking decisions,\" said Ron Hanft, associate director of the Funding Exchange.\n\nShould grantmakers involve multiple stakeholders in every decision-making process? Of course not. There are times when it is perfectly appropriate for foundations to make decisions without a wide range of external input. The key is to engage the right people on the right issues at the right time, rather than asking people to attend lots of meetings or provide input that isn't used. Engagement that isn't skillfully done can do more harm than good to the relationship between grantmakers and grantees. \"It's not a matter of 'hail, hail, the gang's all here',\" said Marianne Hughes, IISC's executive director. \"These efforts need to be guided by an elegant design and a good process for ensuring that you're not wasting people's time.\"\n\nBenefits of Engagement\n\nThe three principal benefits that grantmakers can realize by engaging more actively with grantees and other stakeholders are to develop a deeper understanding of problems, create new and better solutions, and build more effective organizations.\n\nDevelop a Deeper Understanding of Problems. Social ills such as persistent poverty, inadequate health care, and failing schools are complex issues that are difficult to understand fully. That is why it is important for grantmakers to get the input of people who are directly involved in the issue to help provide a more complete picture of the problem. \"These are hard problems to solve,\" said Hughes. \"Involving multiple stakeholders isn't a 'nice to do' but a 'must do' if you really want to get a handle on what's happening, what the toughest problems are, and how to be innovative in developing solutions.\"\n\nWhen the Davis Foundation was introducing Cherish Every Child to the community, Frank Robinson, executive director of the Springfield-based nonprofit Partners for a Healthier Community, was already developing plans to improve children's oral health. The thirteen years that Robinson's organization had been working on health issues in Springfield had convinced him and his colleagues of something that other health leaders around the country increasingly were saying: oral health is a good indicator of childhood wellness, and improving oral health can contribute to better overall outcomes for kids.\n\nBecause of Robinson's involvement oral health became a part of the Cherish Every Child plan. His organization now leads an effort to bring portable oral health services to early childhood education and care providers throughout the county. Now in its fifth year, the initiative has provided services to more than five thousand preschool children. According to recent evaluation results, the overall quality of life of the children in the program was enhanced from the baseline. The program is now being recognized as a national model.\n\n\"That would not have happened without the platform that Cherish Every Child gave us to advance this work,\" said Robinson. \"By uniting this community around early care and education as a priority, the Davis Foundation has created a new appetite and new support for the work we are doing.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Davis Foundation might not have recognized that oral health was even a concern had it not engaged Robinson and others in developing the program. \"Frank's participation put it on everybody's radar that children are facing a very real, very preventable problem when it comes to oral health,\" said Sally Fuller, project director for Cherish Every Child.\n\nCreate New and Better Solutions. Another important benefit that comes when grantmakers engage grantees and other stakeholders is that it results in better solutions. Grantmakers cannot develop practical solutions on their own. And consulting with academics and other \"issue experts,\" although important, is not enough. Rather, effective strategies for addressing the complicated and difficult issues at the heart of so many foundations' work will emerge only from a concerted effort to engage the real experts  those who see these issues playing out in their communities each and every day.\n\nNelson Gonzlez, chief strategy and program officer with the Stupski Foundation, said that philanthropy needs to move from \"an expert focus\" in defining and solving problems to \"a design process that is more collaborative, cross-sector and multidisciplinary.\"\n\nCherish Every Child, for example, has implemented a number of new solutions to improve the health of Springfield's children that were developed as a result of close engagement with members of the community. One of these solutions is a program for new mothers to help improve the health of their new babies. \"Welcome Baby Baskets\" filled with supplies for newborns are offered to all new mothers giving birth at Springfield's Mercy Medical Center. The baskets are delivered to the moms' homes by trained staff from eight community agencies. During the visits, the agency staff engage the mothers in structured conversations about everything from reading to their baby to community resources for new parents. By offering the baskets to all new mothers the program helps erase the stigma that postpartum home visits are only for \"at-risk\" mothers.\n\nData from the first full year of visits indicate that 95 percent of the new mothers requested a \"Welcome Baby\" home visit. In followup phone calls with those who received the visit, fully 100 percent of women contacted were satisfied with (and, in fact, very positive about) their \"Welcome Baby\" visit. What's more, 37 percent of families said the visits had presented them with a new idea, such as the importance of reading to an infant or the importance of infants spending time on their bellies. And 47 percent said they had learned about a new resource because of the visit, such as early intervention services or the availability of low-cost dental care.\n\nFuller said there is \"no way\" that the Davis Foundation could have come up with the idea of the program on its own. Perhaps most significantly, she said the foundation could not have implemented the program without the help of the community agencies staffing the home visits. \"All of these agencies were part of the planning process [for Cherish Every Child], and we would never have been able to reach this number of new mothers without their involvement and ideas,\" she said.\n\nBuild More Effective Organizations. The third important benefit that comes when grantmakers engage grantees and other stakeholders is that it helps build more effective organizations. GEO's Change Agent Project identified problems in the grantmaker-grantee relationship as a crucial barrier to creating effective nonprofit organizations and foundations. Nonprofits that participated in the Change Agent Project regularly expressed a desire for a stronger sense of partnership with their funders, and suggested again and again that improving the relationship would improve their ability to deliver results.\n\nEngaging grantees and community members as active partners in a foundation's grantmaking work can take a variety of forms. The Tiger Foundation, for example, assigns every trustee as a liaison to one of its grantees. Trustees and Tiger staff then conduct regular site visits to grantee locations, observing the program in action, meeting with the leadership, and asking questions about the program, finances, and staff. This creates a deeper understanding of not just the grantee's needs but the community's needs as well.\n\nThe essential ingredient in forming productive engagements is to create ways for stakeholders to provide candid feedback to the foundation about its grantmaking practices and approach. The Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) has conducted anonymous grantee perception reports for more than one hundred and fifty foundations. The Saint Luke's Foundation, for example, commissioned CEP to survey its grantees and nonprofits whose applications for funding were declined. \"We were pleased to see that the results were positive but we also got good feedback on practices we could improve,\" said Denise San Antonio Zeman, the foundation's president and CEO.\n\nGrantmakers also can invite grantees and community members to participate in focus groups, listening sessions, and community convenings. The Ontario Trillium Foundation, for example, created the Community Conversations series, a dialogue that allowed a thousand Ontarians to share their views with the foundation. One message the foundation heard loud and clear, said Dan Wilson, Ontario Trillium's manager of policy, research, and evaluation, was that nonprofits were tired of all the work that went into securing a grant from the foundation. These sentiments echoed what the foundation was hearing in client satisfaction surveys that asked grantees and applicants how they would suggest improving the foundations practices and procedures.\n\nOn the basis of this input, the Ontario Trillium Foundation instituted a simplified application process for small capital requests and is initiating online application and reporting. The foundation also revamped its \"decline\" process so grantees that will not be receiving grants hear about the foundation's decision as soon as it is made.\n\n\"Before you sort of went into a cone of silence where you didn't hear from us until all decisions had been made for that round, and people clearly didn't like waiting,\" Wilson said. He added that grantees have responded favorably to the changes and credited the grantmaker's outreach effort with providing an opportunity \"to help us become more responsive and more effective when it comes to meeting grantee needs.\"\n\nCreating Shared Commitment\n\nFoundations have a unique opportunity to engage the knowledge and passion of those they support. When done well, this engagement leads to shared responsibility for achieving results. Will stakeholder engagement require grantmakers to expend more time and resources than they would if they did not engage with the outside world? Of course. The Davis Foundation could have saved time and effort by creating its own plan for improving the lives of Springfield's children. But the plan would have lacked the broad-based ground-level understanding that the foundation gained by engaging with hundreds of individuals and organizations involved in the Cherish Every Child initiative. It would not have come up with new and creative solutions, such as the Welcome Baby Baskets. And it would have lacked the community support and buy-in that was needed to ensure the successful implementation of the plan.\n\nIn a 2004 evaluation of the planning phase of Cherish Every Child, the University of Massachusetts said the effort had been \"highly successful in bringing a range of players to the table.\" The evaluation attributed the initiative's success to three factors: the leadership of the Davis Foundation, which provided the effort with credibility and legitimacy; the broad scope of the effort, which instead of addressing separate, discrete problems marked an acknowledgment that issues affecting children are intertwined; and the commitment of the community participants, who devoted considerable time and effort to developing a serious set of recommendations.\n\nSusan Berresford, former president of the Ford Foundation, summed up the connection between stakeholder engagement and philanthropic effectiveness in her foreword to the book Effective Philanthropy: Organizational Success Through Deep Diversity and Gender Equality: \"When you bring in excluded groups, fundamental changes occur. That is because those who have been 'outside' bring different perceptions, different frameworks, different questions to the table. And if people in the institution engage with those ideas, they will see problems from new perspectives, get new information, read into more networks, have greater legitimacy in the broad range of people in society, and be stronger and more effective.\"\n\nWalachy framed the engagement-effectiveness connection in simpler terms: \"It's amazing what can happen when you actually listen to people.\"\n\nKathleen P. Enright is president and CEO of Grantmakers for Effective Organizations (GEO), a community of 350 grantmaking organizations who are committed to improving the effectiveness of their nonprofit grantees. Before joining GEO, Enright was group director of marketing and communications for BoardSource. She serves on the board of the Midge Smith Center for Evaluation Effectiveness at George Washington University and is on the advisory board of the Center for Effective Philanthropy.\n\nCourtney Bourns is director of programs for Grantmakers for Effective Organizations, where she focuses on organizational development and change initiatives that require the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Bourns was part of the Interaction Institute for Social Change consulting team that designed and facilitated the Cherish Every Child initiative in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nGrantmaking initiatives often fail when the foundation remains isolated from its grantees and the communities they both serve. To remedy this problem, grantmakers must work more closely with their grantees, community leaders, and other important stakeholders. This engagement helps everyone involved gain a deeper understanding of the problems they are tackling, create new and better solutions, and build more effective organizations ....",

        "content":"The State of Nonprofit America is a wide-ranging collection of essays that addresses how various types of nonprofits, from churches to nursing homes to museums, are faring in the current political climate. Editor Lester M. Salamon, a former deputy associate director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and currently the director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies, is a well-known and prolific writer in the field, and he has pulled together an impressive group of contributors.\n\nThe essays cover a great deal of territory, starting with the historical beginnings of voluntarism in this country and moving on to the earliest private foundations and the origins of infrastructure organizations such as the Foundation Center. The information is posited against the political backdrop of the period, from the Great Society legislation of the 1960s, to the Reagan tax revolution of the 1980s, to welfare reform in the mid-'90s and the current faith-based initiatives of the Bush administration. Throughout, the book's main premise is that the relentless drive for more privatization and greater efficiency in all sectors of society has forced nonprofits to operate more and more like businesses  not least, by demonstrating their results and competing with each other. They're also having to make do with less: During the Reagan years, federal aid to nonprofits decreased by 25 percent, even as demand for their services, fueled by cutbacks in government programs, increased.\n\nThe volume's most informative chapters, in this reviewer's opinion, are chapter 10 (\"Infrastructure Organizations,\" by Alan J. Abramson and Rachel McCarthy), chapter 11 (\"Foundations and Corporate Philanthropy,\" by Leslie Lenkowsky), and chapter 12 (\"Individual Giving and Volunteering,\" by Virginia Hodgkinson, with Kathryn E. Nelson and Edward D. Sivak, Jr.)  although, after reading the book in its entirety, I was left with the sense that the narrative would have flowed better if these chapters, which provide an overview of the sector, had come at the beginning of the book, after Salamon's fine introduction (\"The Resilient Sector: The State of Nonprofit America\").\n\nThe book's other drawback is its considerable reliance on numbers and statistics. Still, some facts did jump out. From 1977 to 1997, for example, the nonprofit sector grew faster than the for-profit sector. Similarly, cutbacks in government funding have led many social service providers to \"medicalize\" themselves, since Medicaid has been left largely intact. And, in the international arena, although the United States appropriates more foreign aid than any nation other than Japan, that aid amounts to only 1 percent of gross national product, putting the U.S. in last place in terms of foreign assistance as a percentage of GNP.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, The State of Nonprofit America should interest policymakers, public policy analysts, nonprofit leaders and practitioners, and anyone hoping to build a career in the sector. Moreover, it couldn't have arrived at a better time. While no new ground is broken by the collection, the rapidly changing interplay among the public, private, and nonprofit sectors merits frequent analysis. And with the federal government threatening greater cuts in funding for the states and proposing tax breaks that would further reduce incentives for the wealthy to give, we need to be reminded that the third sector, while resilient, cannot cure society's ills by itself. Ultimately, as Salamon and his fellow contributors argue, what is needed in these uncertain times is an intelligent and humane collaboration among business, government, and the nonprofit sector.\n\nThe Foundation Center's Rebecca MacLean reviews a wide-ranging collection of essays edited bythe director of the Center for Civil Society Studies at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies that addresses how various types of nonprofits, from churches to nursing homes to museums, are faring in the current political climate....",

        "title":"The Rise of Gender Capitalism",
        "content":"Across a wide spectrum of society there is growing recognition of the central role that women play in the world economy. Books such as former President Jimmy Carter's Call to Action and Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In advocate increased women's empowerment. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a strong case for the economic inclusion of women as a vital source of economic growth when she spoke at the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation High-Level Policy Dialogue on Women and the Economy. And studies by corporations such as Goldman Sachs highlight the potential increases in GDP if women had equal access to employment and credit.\n\nFrom these ideas, as well as from work in women's philanthropy and advocacy for women's corporate leadership, a movement focusing on the nexus of gender and investment is emerging. This movement, which encourages the use of capital to deliver financial returns and improve the lives of women and girls and their communities, is known as \"investing with a gender lens.\"\n\nWhat do we mean by \"lens\"? A lens allows us to see the world differently. Looking through a \"gender lens\" helps investors gain new perspectives, highlight poorly understood inequalities, uncover new opportunities, identify blockages in the system, and find value where none was found before.\n\nWhy \"gender\" and not \"women\"? Although it is focused on the impact of investing on women and girls, the movement uses the term \"gender\" to emphasize that making change means looking at the socially constructed roles, relationships, and expectations of women and men and the ways that these are reinforced by educational, political, economic, and cultural systems. Using \"gender\" brings both men and women into the conversation. The movement's objective is to look at the entire financial and social system, not just at women.\n\nTo understand how a gender lens can change the way investment decisions are made, consider the example of Root Capital, a nonprofit agricultural lender focused on increasing rural prosperity in Latin America and Africa. Root Capital invests in businesses that are too big for microfinance but are unable to get credit from banks  what the organization calls the \"missing middle\" of finance. They not only lend capital but also offer financial training to help farmers and agricultural businesses access markets.\n\nRoot Capital did not start with a gender focus, but in the course of its work the organization learned about the challenges women face in accessing resources like credit, land, training, and agricultural inputs. A gender lens became a starting point for exploring new opportunities for action. Root Capital launched a Women in Agriculture Initiative based on the belief that gender-inclusive businesses  rated by a potential client's percentage of women leaders, women managers, women employees, and women suppliers, as well as inclusive programs and culture  can create greater financial and social impact.\n\nThrough a gender analysis, the organization found that effective investment in agriculture requires attention to the whole social system, from enabling land ownership for women farmers, to empowering middle managers (often women) who are the hidden influencers in small agricultural enterprises, to training entrepreneurs in financial management. A gender lens led Root Capital to identify businesses in traditionally male-dominated industries that have a high impact on women, such as a Nicaraguan collective of women coffee farmers that launched the \"Las Hermanas\" brand of coffee. It also led the organization to focus more on female-dominated but sometimes neglected industries such as shea butter. As a result, a gender lens has expanded, not limited, the range of products and services the lender offers and the types of clients it serves.\n\nDigging Deeper Into Gender\n\nAlthough there is increasing discussion of the role of women in organizations and in the larger economy, the tenor of the conversation has been more about how women can learn to operate within the existing system than about how to overcome structural barriers. Sandberg's Lean In, for example, has been criticized for not taking into account what happens when organizations push back. The breast cancer awareness campaigns that co-brand \"pink\" products have been criticized for benefiting marketers more than women with cancer. We are not saying that women should not lean in or that people should not buy pink products. We are now at the point, however, where we need to go beyond these individualistic concepts. We must engage trillions of dollars of investment capital to capture the gains that come from paying attention to the systemic problem of devaluing women.\n\nInvesting with a gender lens is about creating a new economic logic that bridges the market logic of financial returns with the feminist logic of women's equality. Traditional investors often fear that a focus on women may make them too \"pink,\" and traditional advocates for women's rights often fear that engaging with investors may mean they are selling out. Gender lens investing builds a bridge between these two worlds. It is not about investing in women as if they were commodities, nor abandoning feminism (with its roots in anti-capitalism). Rather, the movement promotes gender analysis as a way of reshaping the system to change what we value as we invest. Paying attention to gender is not just about having a social conscience, nor is it about adding to our list of environmental, social, and governance investment screens. Instead, gender capitalism is about applying a gender lens to highlight the ways that gender is material to financial outcomes and financial outcomes are material to gender.\n\nThere is, however, no universal approach to investing with a gender lens. There are important distinctions between resource-rich and resource-poor settings, between different regions and countries, between different economies, and between different investment products. The ideas and examples in this article are meant as starting points for a larger conversation about how seeing through a gender lens can improve the financial and social returns of investments.\n\nWe focus on three ways that a gender lens can serve this function. The first is gaining access to capital  getting women involved as investors and investees, from Silicon Valley to Bangladesh. The second is promoting workplace equity  using capital to value gender diversity in leadership and promote equal rights throughout company value chains, from top management to the shop floor. The third is creating products and services that affect the lives of women and girls, from clean cookstoves in Africa to pharmaceuticals that have been tested on women and adjusted for them. These three approaches are neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Instead, they are useful analytically in identifying opportunities and uncovering barriers to progress. As the Root Capital example shows, investors may use multiple lenses simultaneously.\n\nGaining Access to Capital\n\nWhen we look through a gender lens, disparities between men and women's ability to access capital become quickly apparent. Across all industries  from retailers to filmmakers to high-tech entrepreneurs  women historically have had trouble gaining access to investment capital, despite evidence that women-led companies may deliver higher and more consistent returns. In addition, there are few women in the business of investing money (in banks, venture capital firms, or hedge funds, for example), which compounds the problem, especially given the tendency for people to invest in and mentor people like themselves.\n\nWomen launching and expanding ventures around the world have an estimated collective credit gap of $320 billion (the difference between the capital they are seeking and the credit to which they have access), which creates a major opportunity for investors. Stereotyping, implicit bias, and constrained networks may leave strong women-led firms without adequate investors. For example, about 6 percent of U.S. venture capital funding goes to women-led businesses. This is not just a supply problem, but also a function of an investment process that subtly discounts women. An important part of the process entrepreneurs must go through to obtain an investment from a venture capitalist is to \"pitch\" their idea in person. But women have been socialized to be less comfortable pitching, and we all have been socialized to perceive women less favorably in those contexts. Experimental studies show that investors are 60 percent more likely to invest in pitches delivered by men than by women, even when the content of the pitches is identical.\n\nInnovative investors are breaking these patterns. Consider Village Capital, an organization that develops and funds innovative social enterprises. Finding that the traditional due diligence process was expensive and not terribly effective, Village Capital created a peer mentoring and peer selection approach that would, in their words, \"democratize the entrepreneurial process.\" They select cohorts of about fifteen entrepreneurs in specific geographic areas and industries for a twelve-week program based on peer mentoring. Village Capital commits to providing funding to the top two enterprises, which are selected on the basis of peer evaluations. The program was not designed specifically to enhance female entrepreneurs' success, but Village Capital found that while only 15 percent of the participating companies had female co-founders, these companies represented 40 percent of the investment winners. Female co-founders have been 2.7 times more likely to get funding through this model, and the differential has increased as Village Capital has improved the structure and transparency of the programs.\n\n\"There are systematic, implicit biases that investors have in the traditional venture world that many don't even recognize and that disproportionately favor men,\" says Ross Baird, executive director of Village Capital. \"When you are more structured, methodical, and transparent and your assumptions are things you have to back up, women-run ventures tend to be appropriately valued.\" The opportunities to rethink investment processes are not limited to incubators and accelerators. The 2013 launch by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of a \"Women's Bond\" has created new legitimacy for focusing on women's access to capital. About $175 million has already been committed by the IFC to banks such as Ita, the largest bank in Brazil, for investments in women-owned businesses. With women starting ventures at unprecedented rates, we are likely to see more innovations like this. Women-focused crowdfunding platforms such as Portfolia, gender-aware venture capital firms such as Illuminate Ventures, regionally focused investment funds like Texas Women Ventures, and nonprofit intermediaries such as Agora all provide investors with access to compelling opportunities.\n\nDespite the flurry of activity, vast scope remains for continued progress. A gender lens on access to capital challenges embedded beliefs about how the system for capital allocation works. Sharon Vosmek, CEO of Astia, an organization helping women participate fully in high-growth entrepreneurship, points out that the venture capital and high-tech world is so captured by the \"myth of meritocracy\" that it can barely start a conversation on gender and cannot see that its understanding of merit is gendered.\n\nGrasping how definitions of \"merit\" may embed criteria biased against women can open investors' eyes to new opportunities. For instance, Illuminate Ventures deliberately recruits women advisors and investors, putting it into a different deal flow from other venture capital firms. The result: About half the companies in Illuminate's portfolio have female co-founders, a share that is dramatically above the industry average of 6 percent. New opportunities also present themselves when investors expand the definition of what type of business constitutes a good investment. For example, women disproportionately start businesses that aim for steady profit rather than rapid growth or a quick and rich exit. Broadening one's definition of an entrepreneur to include the woman filmmaker in Hollywood and the woman coffee farmer in Nicaragua (along with leaders of Silicon Valley high tech startups) also expands the set of investment opportunities.\n\nPromoting Workplace Equity\n\nA gender lens on workplace equity allows the investor to look across the entire corporate value chain and ask, \"How are women's leadership and equal rights valued?\" The answers to that question can lead investors to new areas of opportunity. For example, research shows that the financial returns of companies with three or more women on their board are substantially higher than for companies that have no women on their board. But the power of a gender lens to illuminate risks and opportunities hardly stops at the boardroom door. Evidence shows that inclusive environments are associated with better organizational outcomes and that gender-diverse teams at all levels make better decisions.\n\nInvestors are beginning to see financial opportunities in taking gender into consideration. The Women and Girls Equality Strategy (WGES) is an investment approach developed by U.S. Trust in collaboration with the Women's Foundation of California. The foundation was eager to advance its mission  the economic security of women and girls  through its investments in addition to its grantmaking. Operating in a fiduciary environment where investments must comply with \"prudent investor\" laws that mandate judicious choices about the tradeoffs between risk and return, the foundation also needed to maintain market rate returns. \"We wanted to align our investments with our values, and also to use a gender lens to identify smart investments in companies we're proud to own,\" says Judy Patrick, CEO of the Women's Foundation of California.\n\nU.S. Trust (which employs one of us) leveraged its Socially Innovative Investing platform to create a strategy that looks holistically at how companies engage women  as consumers, employees, and agents of global change. One important metric that investors are beginning to use is the number of women on boards of directors. For example, Morgan Stanley's Parity Portfolio uses this number as an investment screen. The WGES approach adds other metrics to analyze how gender equity plays out throughout the organization. WGES examines quantitative criteria to compare companies with sector peers on factors such as pay equity; recruiting, retaining, and promoting women; supply chain and subcontractor relationships; gender impact of goods and services; and portrayal of women in media. The strategy considers both policy and practice  for example, the existence of policies for inclusive hiring as well as the track record of payments for discrimination lawsuits.\n\nCompanies that score well in the analysis also are likely to have fewer environmental penalties, labor violations, and product safety recalls. In short, they are well-run companies. A gender lens, as it turns out, provides another important set of metrics for separating high-quality companies from the others. \"We employ a disciplined process of portfolio construction that combines this social analysis with fundamental research and an optimization process,\" says Jason Baron, managing director and portfolio manager at U.S. Trust. \"It mitigates against any unintended bias and enables us to design for clients' needs  and attribute any outperformance to selection of companies based on their gender analysis scores.\" In 2013, WGES beat their S&P 1500 benchmark by 3.6 percentage points.\n\nThe goals of gender-focused investment vehicles are both to generate returns and to use the power of these investments to help push companies toward gender equity. Several trends point to the increased value of using a gender lens to look across an entire value chain. Take education: As women are increasingly educated, investors must consider which firms will win the war for talent. Governments like that of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe are seeing the economic benefit of women in the workforce and are establishing incentives for corporations that excel in gender diversity. Coca Cola has embarked on an ambitious campaign, called the 5x20 program (the goal is to empower five million women entrepreneurs across Coca Cola's value chain by 2020), to leverage women's participation throughout its business. The Calvert Foundation, a social investing intermediary, found that the process of launching the pioneering Women Investing in Women fund (a gender-focused investment vehicle) energized its staff and created new client relationships and opportunities.\n\nIncluding gender equity in investment evaluation metrics drives transformative conversations about realities inside and outside organizations. To date, organizations have relied on important, but crude, measures such as counting the number of women at various levels of management. If counting continues to predominate, it risks provoking the backlash of tokenism. Using a gender lens on workplace equity broadens the questions to recognize other dynamics. For example, understanding the gendered context in which people operate  such as research demonstrating that women can be either likable or competent but not both, or that in some cases domestic violence can increase when women's income increases  helps leaders innovate more effectively.\n\nVarious organizations are working to fill the data gap on both gender policies and outcomes. For example, EDGE, a certification process for corporations, looks at the trifecta of policies, outcomes, and employee self-reports. The latter provide an essential understanding of the gendered experience in organizations. That is, innovation will not increase simply by having meetings with more women in a room if these women do not feel free to express their opinions. The certification process highlights areas of opportunity in creating workplaces that harness everyone's talent.\n\nCreating Products and Services\n\nIn some ways, businesses are adept at creating products and services for women and girls. Consider the huge businesses devoted to women's apparel, beauty products, and feminine hygiene. But thinking about providing products and services for women and girls risks being translated into \"sell more stuff to women.\"\n\nThe approach of the gender lens investing movement is different. The goal is to create opportunities and reduce risks by designing products and services (and their value chains) that empower women and girls and improve their lives. This means changing the design process from designing for women to designing with women. It is not about taking products and making them pink. Successes in producing clean cookstoves, in reducing infant mortality, in improving feminine hygiene, and in other areas come from collaborative innovation.\n\nCompanies incur two costs if they don't think about gender as they design their products and services. The first is missed market opportunities and the second is the reputational risk that can come from badly designed products. Some companies are now taking up this challenge. For example, automobile companies have recently begun to test the safety of their cars with female-size crash test dummies in the driver's seat. And some drug companies are beginning to think of the problems and missed opportunities of not adequately testing pharmaceuticals on women. (Clinical studies are disproportionately based on men.)\n\nThe Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is demonstrating the power of investing in products for women. Clean cookstoves and fuels can improve health outcomes related to emphysema, cataracts, and heart disease as well as alleviate economic burdens that disproportionately fall on women and girls. The organization now has more than a thousand partners working to build a global market for clean cookstoves and fuels. What they have found, however, is that adoption of the new cookstoves has been spotty. Some of the challenge lies in designs that do not fit the needs of women  they are engineering solutions from companies mainly in developed economies, but delivering products to people in resource-poor environments.\n\nTo get people to adopt the new cookstoves, the alliance has gone beyond thinking of women as only the users of the products. They have used gender analysis to identify a whole series of best practices, from product design (observe women cooking and involve women in the design esthetics), to production (give women the opportunity to manufacture components), to financing (support financial institutions in lending to women and consider rent-to-own or micro-consignment strategies), to distribution (use gender-informed marketing messages and offer trial periods to female distributors).\n\n\"Previously, we found that cooking energy companies didn't fully understand how a gender-informed approach could help their bottom line. Gender requirements were generally donor-driven and not seen as something that could improve their effectiveness,\" says Corinne Hart, director of gender for the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. \"But now they are seeing how using a gender lens can enhance their business model and increase sales and adoption of their products and services.\"\n\nLessons Learned\n\nSeveral lessons can be drawn from these different approaches that will help investors use a gender lens to guide their decisions. The first is that systems matter. For investors, it is easy to focus on the specific investments without thinking of the systems in which they are embedded. For example, when microfinance works for women, it is not just because of the loans but also because of the entire set of principles and programs that have been created to support women entrepreneurs. When the loan comes with technical assistance, a commitment by the women to have a different relationship with their husbands, and a loan compact that includes support groups, results improve. Similarly, encouraging women entrepreneurs anywhere in the world without confronting the biases in the entire funding system will not increase the number of women-owned businesses. Using a gender lens is about changing processes, not simply working within them.\n\nThe second lesson to be learned about gender lens investing is that metrics are important for creating incentives and for tracking progress, but our current methods are often not sophisticated enough to measure all that is important. Counting the number of women  on corporate boards of directors, in hedge funds  is a good start, but it is not enough. Asking about metrics, collecting data, and reporting the results trigger dialogue and actions to reduce inequities and uncover opportunities, but creating metrics that can reveal systemic issues is hard. As University of Oxford professor Linda Scott and her colleagues showed in a three-year field study of Avon resellers in South Africa, we cannot understand the impact of women's entrepreneurship until we define success according to the criteria of the women themselves. There, key outcomes not often measured in studies of microfinance were changes in self-perception, improvements in self-confidence, and development of expertise that the women experienced.\n\n\nTIPS FOR GENDER LENS INVESTING\n\n\nDesign with women, not for them. Women should be involved at every stage of the discussion about investing with a gender lens, and in significant enough numbers that they are not merely tokens.\n\n\nUse a gender lens to expand rather than narrow opportunities. A gender analysis is not only a screen that narrows the scope of action; it can also uncover hidden opportunities or unexpected insights.\n\n\nDont be afraid of quotas. Quotas are a blunt instrument, but often a useful way to start a conversation. For example, by asking if there are at least three women on a companys board of directors, one can begin a conversation about why there are not.\n\n\nUse a gender lens across the entire value chain. Opportunities for shifting value and empowering women can come during all phases of the process, including financing, design, production, distribution, and after-sales service.\n\n\nDont ask women to change to fit the system. Its not enough to have a meritocratic system, because the criteria people use are often gendered. Instead, find ways to change the system so that outcomes are truly equal.\n\n\nAssume implicit bias against women until proven otherwise. Men and women alike are socialized within a gendered system. Look for unconscious bias in metrics, decision-making processes, and how things are done around here.\n\n\nStart. There are lots of subtleties, but it is important to start the process. Focusing on gender can feel like a minefield, but the upside of uncovering hidden opportunities is too good to pass up.\n\n\n\nThe third lesson for gender lens investing is that women must be at the table in all of these conversations, and in adequate numbers. As Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister, famously said, \"If Lehman Brothers had been 'Lehman Sisters', today's economic crisis clearly would look quite different.\" A token woman on a panel or on a leadership team does not make for effective representation. (In fact, research shows that tokenism can often be worse.) This cannot be a women-only conversation. We are all implicated in the current gendered systems of capital allocation, and the only way out is for everyone to see the world through gender lenses.\n\nMoving Into the Mainstream\n\nThe important question we must now answer is how to move gender lens investing from the fringe to the center of the discussion. The sustainability movement took years to be taken seriously but has now entered the mainstream with thematic investment funds attracting assets. Corporations like Wal-Mart Stores now produce sustainability reports and are asked by their shareholders to address environmental, social, and governmental issues. As we reflect on what it will take to build the field, we see three immediate barriers as well as some openings that make us optimistic.\n\nFirst, there are not enough investment vehicles that leverage a gender lens. One fix for this deficiency is for investors to demand access to these types of investments. This can be a virtuous or vicious cycle: Without demand, supply will be suppressed, but greater demand can instigate innovation. A quicker fix is for investment managers to add gender metrics to their existing analyses.\n\nSecond, we lack the data needed to design smart investments. We have to get to the point where gender-disaggregated data is a de rigueur consideration when making investments. And we need different kinds of data that support gender analyses (such as the surveys that EDGE is now doing). Some of these data should include case studies that can show how investing with a gender lens can be done. More data will create both the \"proof points\" to justify action and the \"signposts\" for those who want to act.\n\nThird, concurrent with the development of data, the field needs to develop expertise in bridging the two domains of gender and finance. Investors and financial institutions need skills in doing a gender analysis. Women's empowerment organizations would benefit from expertise in using finance as a tool in the toolkit. Today, few people can speak both languages, and few organizations know how to make the connections. Building the field will be essentially about finding ways to build these forms of expertise.\n\nThe financial crisis from which we are just emerging has caused many people to question the foundations of the existing system. Moments of crisis can create opportunities for systems change. Can a gender lens help us move forward from the current upheaval in financial markets and the broader economic crisis? Given the increasing attention to women and the economy, can a gender lens on investing offer tangible solutions for making progress?\n\n\n\nThis content represents the thoughts of the authors and does not necessarily represent the position of Bank of America or U.S. Trust. \n\nIn the latest article in our SSIR series,Sarah Kaplan, associate professor of strategic management at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, and Jackie VanderBrug, a senior vice president and investment strategist at U.S. Trust, explain an emerging movement to improve outcomes for everyone by linking feminist and financial goals.",

        "content":"Any traces of the \"compassionate conservatism\" championed by George W. Bush in the early days of his administration has long since evaporated under the heat of Republican extremism. Today, more than three-quarters of American conservatives think the poor \"have it easy,\" while fewer than 10 percent believe the \"poor have hard lives\" and receive inadequate assistance.\n\nWhat's more, many conservatives believe the poor have easy lives because \"they get government benefits without doing anything,\" ignoring not only the limits of public aid, but also the obstacles that must be overcome to obtain food stamps, Medicaid, day care, public housing, and other kinds of government assistance. In fact, more than 80 percent of conservatives also say that the government programs on which the poor so desperately depend do more harm than good.\n\nCan four out of five conservatives really be so hard-hearted that they cannot imagine how profoundly difficult life is for people without enough money to feed their children, to fill an essential prescription for an ill parent, or to access a safe place to leave an infant while they try to find a part-time, no-benefits, minimum-wage job that gives them no hope of escaping what in many cases are slum- and crime-ridden neighborhoods? \"Have it easy?\" Really?\n\nThese findings are consistent in that more than half of conservatives believe that people are poor because of \"lack of effort,\" while fewer than 30 percent of conservatives believe poverty results from \"circumstances beyond [an individual's] control.\" Despite all we have learned over the years about the causes of poverty and related ills, conservatives seem bound and determined to reduce the issue to the simple fact of people making bad decisions and doing bad things.\n\nThat kind of thinking ought to be greeted with dismay by most charities, even if their missions address problems other than poverty. Blaming the victim does not make the work of nonprofits any easier, does not incline people to support well-meaning interventions, and, at the end of the day, is the opposite of charitable. Indeed, with respect to most problems of concern to nonprofits, there is nopath forward if people are seen as thesole source of their own troubles.\n\nSo let me remind conservatives of a few important facts: There are more than 50 million people in the United States today living at or below the poverty line a higher rate of poverty than at any time since the 1960s. Moreover, nearly one in four American children live in poverty the second-highest rate among the thirty-five most economically developed nations.And the figure jumps to more than one of every two childrenif we include children living in \"low-income\" families.\n\nIs poverty the fault of these children? Folks on the right don't seem to care, with close to 90 percent of conservatives asserting that \"everyone has it in their own power to succeed.\" Never mind that research has shown that people who grew up in poverty are much more likely to be poor as adults, and to have children who grow up to be poor.\n\nAnd while a majority of Americans know that race still matters, more than 80 percent of conservatives say \"blacks who can't get ahead are responsible for their own condition.\" Again, really?\n\nAfter all, neurological and other types of studies show that the very condition of living in poverty reproduces it. But conservatives tend to ignore science when it contradicts their ideology. For instance, 46 percent of Republicans believe that global warming is \"not happening,\" while more than 70 percent say we have \"gone too far to protect the environment,\" even as 99.9 percent of climate scientists say that man-made global warming is a real and growing threat.\n\nSuch ideologically driven obstinacy ought to worry the entire nonprofit and philanthropic sector. Those of us who want to build a better world need the public and policy makers to see what's what and to act with compassion even when they don't.\n\nSadly, there's too little of either among conservatives today.\n\nAnd that's a problem, because it is contributing to growing political polarization. According to the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, \"Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades.\" Meanwhile, Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to see those with opposing views as a \"threat to the nation's well-being.\"\n\nYou don't need me to tell you that our well-being is suffering. According to the Social Progress Imperative, a relatively new initiative that measures multiple dimensions of social progress and human well-being in over one hundred countries, the U.S. doesn'trank in the top ten in terms of overall social progress (we're sixteenth),comes ina disappointing twenty-third in the category of Basic Human Needs (nutrition, basic health care, shelter, etc.) and ranks a dismal thirty-sixth in the category of Foundations of Well-Being (school enrollment, phone/internet access, life expectancy, ecosystem health, etc.).\n\nIn other words, there is lots of room for improvement. And improvement is going to require the efforts of both government and the nonprofit sector. While roughly 80 percent of those who hold strongly conservative views believe regulations do more harm than good, it should be clear to a majority of Americans that the \"mediating institutions  voluntary associations, local government, church [sic], and, above all, the family\" so valued by conservatives do not alone have the power to solve the daunting problems we face as a nation and a people.\n\nThe good news is that even though the percentage of non-ideologically-driven Americans has shrunk by about a fifth over the last two decades, there remains a large center comprising roughly 40 percent of all Americans who may be willing and happy to work with charities to achieve social progress. It is to those people that nonprofits must speak.\n\nCharities need to go beyond service provision and enlist large numbers of Americans free of rigid ideological views to support programs and policies that can remedy the problems that bedevil so many of us. We know that those at either end of the ideological spectrum are more likely to vote and to be involved in the political process. The only way to mitigate political polarization is to activate  both charitably and in the democratic process  those in the broad middle. Unless and until charities and foundations turn to that task, the causes, communities, and people we serve will continue to suffer.\n\nMark Rosenman is emeritus professor at Union Institute & University and a frequent contributor to PhilanTopic.

        "content":"A growing number of grantmaking organizations in Washington, D.C., have begun to experiment with loans and equity investments that require nonprofits or socially minded businesses to repay the money over time, the Washington Post reports.\n\nKnown as impact investing, the practice has been embraced by organizations such as the Case Foundation and Accion International, which increasingly are looking to provide seed money to nonprofits to launch profit-making social enterprises that advance a social mission while generating meaningful revenue for the nonprofit. The Calvert Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland, for example, has invested in nonprofit organizations for a decade and a half but insists that they have a track record of success, assets of at least $5 million, and experience in repaying borrowed capital. While the organization has been criticized for \"cherry-picking\" the best investments, Calvert's president, Lisa Hall, says that is precisely the point. \"We're investing in deals that are going to raise money. That is one of the challenges in our work of impact investing, to make sure you're investing in things where there is a clear earned revenue model and where there is a track record.\"\n\nFor their part, nonprofits seeking impact investments not only have to consider how an enterprise can produce revenue, but also what they need to do to ensure that the new program or programs align with their mission. One well-known example is D.C. Central Kitchen's fifteen-year-old Fresh Start Catering business, which is staffed by former convicts and recovering addicts. Last year, the business and contracts to provide healthy meals to area schools and temporary housing facilities generated $5.5 million in revenue for the foodbank  more than half its annual budget.\n\n\"To be a high-functioning, productive social enterprise, you have to be driven by the mission first,\" D.C. Central Kitchen CEO Mike Curtin told the Post. \"When we bring some money to the bottom line, it makes it even better.\"\n\nA growing number of grantmaking organizations in the D.C. area have begun to experiment with loans and equity investments that require nonprofits or socially minded businesses to repay the money over time....",

But by doing away with massive printing costs, the Internet may be making it easier for such news outlets to flourish. Indeed, plagued by shrinking circulation and advertising revenues, many traditional newspapers are shedding staff, downsizing their offerings, and literally shrinking the size of their pages in an effort to compete with their online counterparts.\n\nOne of those newcomers, the Voice of San Diego, has won numerous awards during its short existence, despite a small staff. Its coverage tends to be earnest and serious, focused on growth, housing, and politics rather than traditional community news fare such as fires and high school sports. And though its readership is small  the site attracts roughly 17,000 visitors a day, compared to the San Diego Union-Tribune's paid weekday circulation of more than 278,000  donors to the site support it to the tune of $600,000 a year.\n\nInfluenced by the success of the Voice, other nonprofit news projects have been established in a number of cities, including St. Louis, New Haven, and Minneapolis, where, in November, the nonprofit MinnPost launched print and online editions. Meanwhile, ProPublica, a new nonprofit investigative-journalism organization based in New York City, is planning to hire veteran journalists and offer its stories free to media outlets.\n\nAlthough free of bottom-line pressures, nonprofit news outlets still face challenges, including the \"church-state\" conflicts that plague all news operations. And unless they are able to drum up permanent funding, many such outlets will struggle to keep their doors open. Still, Voice of San Diego executive editor Scott Lewis remains optimistic.

And while many of the early projects were technology-related, organizations now realize they can outsource tasks such as creating brochures and logos. \"If I could send a volunteer to Chile to teach an organization how to build a Web site, that will be ten times better than having us build it for them, but it's a hundred times more expensive,\" said Charles Brennick, whose Seattle-based InterConnection group links volunteer Web designers with development groups abroad.\n\nIn addition, online volunteers and the organizations they help generally communicate by e-mail or instant messaging, rarely by telephone. This saves often-limited funds and other resources by not having to provide work spaces and other support.\n\nBut online volunteering isn't practical for everything and is as time-consuming as traditional efforts. According to Elise Bouvet, a specialist with U.N. Volunteers Online, online volunteering assignments carry the same commitment, communication, and management requirements as onsite opportunities. \"In both theory and practice, it's still volunteering,\" she said. \"Only the tool that you are using is different.\"\n\nAs Internet access improves worldwide, online voluntarism is growing, particularly among African and Latin American organizations needing assistance....",

        "title":"The Dawn of System Leadership",
        "content":"With the passing of Nelson Mandela in late 2013, the world celebrated a remarkable life. But the spotlight on Mandela's accomplishments relegated to the shadows much of the reason that he has had such a lasting impact, in South Africa and beyond. Above all, Mandela embodied what it means to be a system leader, someone able to bring forth collective leadership. In countless ways, large and small, Mandela undertook interventions aimed at bringing together the various factions of a divided country to face common challenges collectively and build a new nation.\n\nIn the four delicate years between his release from prison in 1990 and South Africa's first open election, Mandela supported a scenario process that brought together formerly banned black political parties to work through their alternative visions for the country's future. Exploring their different ideologies and the implications of those ideologies openly and together resulted in the moderating of potentially divisive differences such as whether or not to nationalize critical industries that could have ripped the nation apart.\n\nPerhaps the most transcendent example of Mandela as a system leader was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a radical innovation in the emotional healing of the country that brought black and white South Africans together to confront the past and join in shaping a collective future. The simple idea that you could bring together those who had suffered profound losses with those whose actions led to those losses, have them face each other and tell their truths, forgive, and move on was not only a profound gesture of civilization but a catalyst for the creation of collective leadership. Indeed, the process would have been impossible without the leadership of people like Bishop Desmond Tutu and former President F. W. de Klerk.\n\nEven more, the process invited the thousands who participated to step forward in co-creating a new reality for South Africa  and, in so doing, to embody an ancient understanding of leadership; the Indo-European root of \"to lead,\" leith, literally means to step across a threshold  and to let go of whatever might keep participants in the process from moving forward.\n\nAt no time in history have we needed such system leaders more. We face a host of systemic challenges beyond the reach of existing institutions and their hierarchical authority structures. Problems like climate change, the destruction of ecosystems, the growing scarcity of water, youth unemployment, and embedded poverty and inequity require unprecedented collaboration among different organizations, sectors, and even countries. In response to this need, countless collaborative initiatives have emerged in the past decade  locally, regionally, and even globally. Yet more often than not they have floundered  in part because they failed to foster collective leadership within and across the collaborating organizations.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to share what we are learning about the kinds of leaders needed to foster collective leadership. We hope to demystify what it means to be a system leader and what one can do to continue to grow as one. It is easy when we talk about exemplars like Mandela to reinforce a belief that these are special people, somehow walking on a higher plane than the rest of us. But we have had the honor to work with many \"Mandelas,\" and our experience has convinced us that they share core capabilities and that those capabilities can be developed. Although formal position and authority matter, we have watched people contribute as system leaders from many positions. As Ronald Heifetz has shown in his work on adaptive leadership, these leaders shift the conditions under which others learn collectively to make progress against a particular problem. Most of all, we have learned by watching the personal development of system leaders in different areas. This isn't easy work, and those who make progress have a particular commitment to their own learning and growth. Understanding the \"gateways\" through which they pass clarifies this commitment and helps to explain why system leadership is not the mysterious domain of a chosen few.\n\nToday, many of us are \"swimming in the same river\"  trying to cultivate collective leadership in diverse settings around the world even while our larger cultural contexts remain firmly anchored to the myth of the heroic individual leader. This search for a new type of leadership creates a real possibility to accelerate joint learning about system leaders. For, undoubtedly, we are at the beginning of the beginning in learning how to catalyze and guide systemic change at a scale commensurate with the scale of problems we face, and all of us see but dimly.\n\nCore Capabilities of System Leaders\n\nThough they differ widely in personality and style, genuine system leaders have a remarkably similar impact. Over time, their profound commitment to the health of the whole organization results in a similar commitment in others. Their ability to see reality through the eyes of people very different from themselves encourages others to be more open as well. They build relationships based on deep listening, and as a result networks of trust and collaboration start to flourish. They are so convinced that something can be done that they do not wait for a fully developed plan, thereby freeing others to step up and learn by doing. Indeed, one of their greatest contributions often comes from the strength of their ignorance, which gives them permission to ask obvious questions and to embody an openness and commitment to their own ongoing learning and growth that eventually infuses larger change efforts.\n\nAs these system leaders emerge, situations suffering from polarization and inertia become more fluid, and what were previously seen as intractable problems become perceived as opportunities for innovation. Short-term reactive problem solving becomes more balanced with long-term value creation. And organizational self-interest becomes re-contextualized, as people discover that their success  and the success of their organization  depends on creating well-being within the larger systems of which they are a part.\n\nThere are three core capabilities that system leaders must develop in order to foster collective leadership. The first is the ability to see the larger system. In any complex setting, people typically focus their attention on the parts of the system most visible from their own vantage point. This usually results in arguments about who has the right perspective on the problem. Helping people see the larger system is essential to building a shared understanding of complex problems. This understanding enables collaborating organizations to jointly develop solutions not evident to any of them individually and to work together for the health of the whole system rather than pursue symptomatic fixes to individual pieces.\n\nThe second capability involves fostering reflection and more generative conversations. Reflection means thinking about our thinking, holding up the mirror to see the assumptions we carry into any conversation, and appreciating how our mental models may limit us. Deep, shared reflection is a critical step in enabling groups of organizations and individuals to actually \"hear\" a point of view different from their own and to appreciate each other's realityemotionally as well as cognitively. This, in turn, is essential for building trust where distrust has prevailed and for fostering collective creativity.\n\nThe third capability centers on shifting the collective focus from reactive problem solving to co-creating the future. Change often starts with conditions that are undesirable, but artful system leaders help people move beyond just reacting to problems to more positive visions of the future. This typically happens gradually as leaders help people articulate their deeper aspirations and build confidence based on tangible accomplishments achieved together. This shift involves not just building inspiring visions but facing difficult truths about the present reality and learning how to use the tension between vision and reality to inspire truly new approaches.\n\nMuch has been written about these leadership capabilities in the organizational learning literature and the tools that support their development. But much of this work is still relatively unknown, or known only superficially, to those engaged in collaborative systemic change efforts.\n\nGateways to Becoming a System Leader\n\nMany years ago, a mentor of ours, William O'Brien, past CEO of Hanover Insurance Companies, posed an important question: \"Many business leaders espouse ideals like vision, purposefulness, and growing people to grow results. If these aims are so widely shared, then why are organizations that practice them so rare?\" O'Brien's answer was simple: \"I think it is because very few people appreciate the nature of the commitment needed to build such an enterprise.\" We believe this insight also applies to budding system leaders seeking to help build collaborative networks for systemic change.\n\nWatching people grow as system leaders has shown us repeatedly the depth of commitment it requires and has clarified the particular gateways through which budding system leaders begin their developmental journey. These gateways do not define the whole of the journey, but they do determine whether or not it ever begins. Those unwilling to pass through them may say all the right things about system leadership, but they are unlikely to make much progress in embodying their aspirations.\n\nRe-directing attention: seeing that problems \"out there\" are \"in here\" as well  and how the two are connected. Continuing to do what we are currently doing but doing it harder or smarter is not likely to produce very different outcomes. Real change starts with recognizing that we are part of the systems we seek to change. The fear and distrust we seek to remedy also exist within us  as do anger, sorrow, doubt, and frustration. Our actions will not become more effective until we shift the nature of the awareness and thinking behind the actions.\n\nRoca, Inc.is a community youth development organization founded in the Boston area in 1988. Roca works with youth whom, by and large, no one else will work with. Many of the organization's staff are former gang members who now work on the streets to help current gang members redirect their lives. In 2013, 89 percent of the high-risk youth in Roca's program for parolees and ex-convicts had no new arrests, 95 percent had no new technical violations, and 69 percent remained employed. On the strength of these outcomes, in 2013 the state of Massachusetts entered into a $27 million pay-for-success agreement with Roca, whereby Roca will be paid to keep at-risk youth out of prison, receiving remuneration directly in proportion to the positive outcomes it is able to achieve.\n\nCritical to Roca's success has been its ability to build transformative relationships with the young people with whom it works. It does this by what it calls \"relentless\" outreach and relationship building. \"Our first job is simply to 'show up' for kids,\" says founder and CEO Molly Baldwin. \"The truth is that many have never had someone they could count on consistently in their lives.\"\n\nShowing up for young people means using processes like \"peacekeeping circles,\" a Native American practice that Roca has adapted and applied to diverse settings, from street conflicts to sentencing and parole. The practice begins by getting all the critical players in any situation into a circle and opening with each person saying a few words about his deepest intentions. The central idea behind the circle is that what affects the individual affects the community, and that both need to be healed together. \"We learn to listen to each other in a deep way in circles,\" says Roca youth worker Omar Ortez. \"You see that a problem is not just one person's problem, it is all our problem.\"\n\nDeveloping peacekeeping circles has not been easy for anyone, including Baldwin. At Roca's first circle training fifteen years ago, \"Forty people came  young people, police and probation officers, community members, and friends,\" she recalls. \"Halfway through the opening session, everything blew up. People were screaming, the kids were swearing, everyone was saying, 'See! This is never going to work!' Watching the session break down was wrenching, but eventually I understood how committed I was to divisiveness and not unity, how far I was from being a peacemaker. I understood on a visceral level the problems with 'us and them' thinking, and how I perpetuated that, personally and for the organization. Continuing to insist, 'I'm right, you're wrong! The issue is you, not us, because we hold the moral high ground!' was a big source of what was limiting our ability to truly help people and situations.\"\n\nIn their book Leading from the Emerging Future, Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer describe three \"openings\" needed to transform systems: opening the mind (to challenge our assumptions), opening the heart (to be vulnerable and to truly hear one another), and opening the will (to let go of pre-set goals and agendas and see what is really needed and possible). These three openings match the blind spots of most change efforts, which are often based on rigid assumptions and agendas and fail to see that transforming systems is ultimately about transforming relationships among the people who shape those systems. Many otherwise well-intentioned change efforts fail because the leaders of those efforts are unable or unwilling to embrace this simple truth. Baldwin's development as a system leader started with her willingness to face her own biases and shortcomings (and how these shortcomings limited Roca's effectiveness in their work), and her openness to set a different tone for the whole organization.\n\nToday, this willingness to open the mind, heart, and will has extended far beyond the four walls of Roca as the organization has evolved into a critical interface between gangs, police, courts, parole boards, schools, and social service agencies. Indeed, among Roca's important allies are the police departments in the communities it serves. It has been a long journey for former social activists who often saw the cops as the enemy.\n\nRe-orienting strategy: creating the space for change and enabling collective intelligence and wisdom to emerge. Ineffective leaders try to make change happen. System leaders focus on creating the conditions that can produce change and eventually cause change to be self-sustaining. As we continue to unpack the prerequisites to success in complex collaborative efforts, we appreciate more and more this subtle shift in strategic focus and the distinctive powers of those who learn how to create the space for change.\n\nFor Darcy Winslow, the journey to becoming a system leader began in 1998 when she was responsible for Nike's advanced research department and was reviewing a gas chromatograph toxicological analysis that, she says, showed \"for the first time the chemicals embedded in one of our top running shoes. Our VP of product looked at the results  the known toxins embedded in our products and processes and the many chemicals that posed uncertain risks  and then surprised us by asking what we thought he should do. We figured he was the head of this part of the business and would know. But after some time, we understood. The stuff that was in our products was there because of cost, function, and our design and material choices. The real question became, 'Who could  and should  lead in tackling this truly complex problem?'\"\n\nOver the ensuing weeks and months Winslow had an epiphany. \"Nike creates products,\" she says. \"Our first maxim is, 'It is in our nature to innovate'. The people we had to reach were the designers. While Nike had about twenty-five thousand employees at that time, there were only about three hundred designers. Five to ten percent of our designers represented only fifteen to thirty people. Suddenly, building an initial critical mass seemed far less daunting. So I went knocking on doors.\"\n\nWith the report in hand, Winslow simply showed the results to designers and asked what they thought. \"You could tell within two minutes if the person was stirred up to do anything,\" she says. \"If they weren't, I moved on. If they were, I asked for a second meeting.\"\n\nSoon she was bringing together groups of engaged designers and others in related product creation functions, and a new network started to emerge. \"If you tell a great designer something is impossible  like you cannot make a world-class running shoe without glues  they get very excited. It is the challenge that engages them.\" Within two years, about four hundred designers and product managers convened for a two-day summit where leading sustainability experts and senior management explored together the concept of design for sustainability. A movement was born within Nike.\n\nToday, Nike's efforts have spurred collective leadership throughout the sports apparel industry with regard to waste, toxicity, water, and energy. For example, the Joint Roadmap Towards Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals, a joint initiative of Greenpeace, Nike, Puma, Adidas, New Balance, and others, aims to systematically identify major toxins and achieve zero discharge of hazardous chemicals in the sport apparel manufacturing industry worldwide, starting in China. (Winslow left Nike in 2008 and is now managing director of the Academy for Systemic Change.)\n\nWe are all on a steep learning curve in terms of understanding this gateway of creating space for change, but it seems to be crucial not only in initiating collaborative efforts but in what ultimately can arise from them. A few years ago, one of us co-authored an article describing five conditions for achieving progress at large scale through a disciplined approach to collaboration called \"collective impact.\" Today as we research and observe effective collective impact initiatives, what stands out beyond the five conditions is the collective intelligence that emerges over time through a disciplined stakeholder engagement process  the nature of which could never have been predicted in advance.\n\nSystemic change needs more than data and information; it needs real intelligence and wisdom. Jay Forrester, the founder of the system dynamics method that has shaped our approach to systems thinking, points out that complex non-linear systems exhibit \"counterintuitive behavior.\" He illustrates this by citing the large number of government interventions that go awry because they aim at short-term improvement in measurable symptoms but ultimately worsen the underlying problem  for example, increased urban policing that leads to short-term reductions in crime rates but does nothing to alter the sources of embedded poverty and worsens long-term incarceration rates. Another systems thinking pioneer, Russell Ackoff, characterized wisdom as the ability to distinguish the short-term from long-term effects of an intervention. The question is, How does the wisdom to transcend pressures for low-leverage symptomatic interventions arise in practice?\n\nSystem leaders like Baldwin and Winslow understand that collective wisdom cannot be manufactured or built into a plan created in advance. And it is not likely to come from leaders who seek to \"drive\" their predetermined change agenda. Instead, system leaders work to create the space where people living with the problem can come together to tell the truth, think more deeply about what is really happening, explore options beyond the conventional wisdom, and search for higher leverage changes through an iterative process of action, reflection, and learning over time. Knowing that there are no easy answers to truly complex problems, system leaders cultivate the conditions wherein collective wisdom emerges over time through a process that gradually brings about new ways of thinking, acting, and being.\n\nFor those new to system leadership, creating space can seem passive or even weak. For many, strong leadership is all about executing a plan. Plans are, of course, always needed, but without openness people can miss what is emerging, like a sailor so committed to his course that he neglects to adjust to shifts in the wind. Even more to the point, the conscious acts of creating space, of engaging people in genuine questions, and of convening around a clear intention with no hidden agenda creates a very different type of energy from that which arises from seeking to get people committed to your plan. When Winslow went to the designers, she went with basic data and a big question: \"What do you think about this and what should we do?\" Her success in building, over fifteen years, an extraordinary network of collaboration and shared commitment started with this basic shift in strategy. System leaders understand that plans and space are the yang and yin of leadership. Both are needed. But what is needed even more is balance between the two.\n\nPractice, practice, practice: all learning is doing, but the doing needed is inherently developmental. Bringing together diverse stakeholders with little history of collaboration, different mental models, and different (and often competing) aims is a high-risk undertaking. Good intentions are not enough. You need skills. But skills come only from practice. Everybody wants tools for systemic change. But too few are prepared to use the tools with the regularity and discipline needed to build their own and others' capabilities.\n\nThis is why system leaders like Baldwin and Winslow never stop practicing how to help people see the larger systems obscured by established mental models, how to foster different conversations that gradually build genuine engagement and trust, and how to sense emerging possibilities and help shift the collective focus from just reacting to problems to releasing collective creativity. The practice is internal and external, and it requires discipline.\n\nFortunately, a rich set of tools has emerged from diverse fields over the past few decades for developing these core system leadership capabilities. The tools that matter have two functions: they produce practical benefits and they affect how people think and see the world. As the inventor Buckminster Fuller said, \"If you want to change how a person thinks, give up. You cannot change how another thinks. Give them a tool, the use of which will gradually cause them over time to think differently.\"\n\nWhat follows are examples of a few of these tools and how they can be applied to develop each of the core leadership capacities mentioned above.\n\nTools for seeing the larger system. Tools that help people see the larger system integrate the different mental models of multiple stakeholders to build a more comprehensive understanding. Often this starts with simple questions like Winslow's \"Do we know what's in our product?\" For educators, it might be: \"What learning opportunities and support are available for children outside of school?\" Systems mapping can be used to extend this inquiry by helping stakeholders build a visual picture of the relationship, including interdependencies beyond the boundaries they normally assume.\n\nFor example, in an initiative focused on improving children's asthma outcomes in Dallas, a steering committee comprised of doctors, hospital administrators, community agencies, insurance providers, the city health department, faith-based organizations, built-environment executives, philanthropists, and public school officials worked together to map out the system of children's health of which they were all a part. Leaders of the effort agreed up front that they needed all these different views of children's asthma in the community in order to develop a full perspective. It was also clear, as the group engaged in dialogue, that each person's perspective on the causes of poor asthma outcomes, and the solutions to produce better outcomes, was different.\n\nThe systems map the group developed helped all involved to see the entire system better, and enabled each professional to see aspects affecting children's health that were less evident in their own work. Eventually, the group created what it called the \"asthma wellness equation,\" which translated insights from the systems map into an illustration that knit together the science of asthma triggers, the practices of asthma management, and the leadership of families and community in creating support structures that promote a sense of efficacy within asthmatic children themselves. The map especially helped clinical professionals put in perspective the often-overlooked influence of family and community on asthma. And it helped non-clinical actors, such as schools and public housing administrators, see more clearly how their actions were linked to those within the medical community.\n\nTools for fostering reflection and generative conversation. Tools that help foster reflection and generative conversation are aimed at enabling groups to slow down long enough to \"try on\" other people's viewpoints. These tools enable organizations and individuals to question, revise, and in many cases release their embedded assumptions. Examples include the peacekeeping circles used by Roca and the dialogue interviews conducted by Winslow.\n\nTwo other tools we often have seen used by system leaders are \"peer shadowing\" and \"learning journeys.\" Both tools have been used to build the Sustainable Food Lab, a network comprising more than seventy of the world's largest food companies and roughly as many global and local NGOs working to make \"sustainable agriculture the mainstream system.\" Starting in 2004, with Oxfam, Unilever, and the Kellogg Foundation as initial conveners, a team of thirty senior managers from food businesses and social and environmental NGOs spent time in each others' organizations and traveled to see aspects of the food system they had never seen. Corporate executives visited farmer co-ops and social activists saw the operations of multinational food companies. \"This almost never happens in our normal busy focus on tasks and results,\" says Andre van Heemstra, a member of the management board at Unilever and the founding Lab team. Gradually, as business and NGO partners got to know each other better as people and as professionals, the cognitive dissonance between them grew less, and the power of their differing but not incompatible views grew. \"We do see the world very differently, and that is our greatest strength,\" said a corporate participant about a year into the process. Today the Lab has become a powerful incubator of collaborative projects involving companies and NGOs learning together how to manage global supply chains for long-term sustainability. Practices like learning journeys are regularly incorporated into projects and gatherings.\n\nEmbedded in tools like peacekeeping circles, dialogue interviews, peer shadowing, and learning journeys is a disciplined approach to observation and deeper conversations called the \"Ladder of Inference.\" System leaders committed to practicing with the ladder learn to pay better attention to how their often unconscious assumptions shape their perceptions, how the data they do and do not notice affect the conclusions they draw. The ladder also provides a reorientation path for shifting behavior, from asserting subjective assumptions as reality to identifying what facts people actually have and the reasoning by which they interpret those facts. Winslow calls it \"an essential tool for the deeper listening that builds networks of collaborating change leaders.\"\n\nTools for shifting from reacting to co-creating the future. Building the capacity to shift from reaction to co-creation is anchored in relentlessly asking two questions: What do we really want to create? And, What exists today? This creative tension, the gap between vision and reality, generates energy, like a rubber band stretched between two poles. Helping themselves and others generate and sustain this creative tension becomes one of the core practices of system leaders.\n\nOne approach embodying creative tension that we have seen is the Appreciative Inquiry (AI) Summit. An initiative begun in 2010 used an AI Summit to bring together police, grassroots advocates, court officials, probation officers, state agencies, private agencies, education institutions, health care providers, and philanthropic leaders to discuss reform of the New York state juvenile justice system. At the outset, few thought it possible to get this group of twenty stakeholders to agree (one group was actually suing another). But no one had ever brought them together for real dialogue and to explore the visions they might share.\n\nTo start, people were encouraged to collectively imagine that \"The rates of recidivism in New York State have become the lowest in the nation...and the New York State juvenile justice system has become a model for other communities across the nation.\" Buoyed, almost miraculously, by collectively imagining the dimensions of this compelling future, the group eventually was able to agree on two goals they could work toward: improving public safety and effectively rehabilitating youth who were involved with the state justice system.\n\nWithin ten months, the group had turned those goals into a full-fledged reform plan. A year later, components of the plan were adopted by the governor, passed into law, and rolled out in communities across the state. Today, three years in, New York has 45 percent fewer youth in the custody of the state juvenile justice system and has not seen any increases in crime. Many participants from the AI Summit now consider it a seminal event that turned the tide from people holding on to past realities to their forming a network of organizations and individuals excited about a more compelling future.\n\nThis example illustrates something we have seen again and again. The basic idea of shifting from problem solving to creating is not complicated, but the impact can be immense. \"As managers, we are all good problem solvers,\" says Winslow. \"But it is easy to get so caught up in reacting to what we don't want and completely failing to tap the heart and imagination of people's genuine caring for what they do want, and to use this energy to transcend the 'us versus them' mindset.\" We also have seen that nurturing the collective creative approach happens most reliably in concert with helping people see the larger system, fostering reflection, and having different conversations  each of which is bolstered in the AI Summit method.\n\nLast, system leaders are ever-mindful of the composition and character of groups practicing with learning tools like those above. Tools become truly developmental only in the hands of people open to their own development. But you can also have open groups who possess little power to take action, just as you can have powerful groups with little openness. No group is perfect. This is why system leaders never stop working at the fine art of \"getting the right people in the room.\"\n\nGuides for Moving Along the Path\n\nClearly the path to becoming a system leader is not a simple journey. As in any daunting undertaking, it is useful to have a few simple guides to keep in mind.\n\nLearning on the job. Growing as a system leader is a process that never ends, and to be successful the process must be integrated into the work itself. Although training and other episodic interventions can help, they are most useful when embedded in a work culture that fosters ongoing reflection and collaboration. Most organizations are consumed by the tasks at hand. Others spend large amounts of money on staff development with little return. The missing element is often a clear vision for how the work itself becomes developmental. This means employing models of change that weave together outcome, process, and human development  all of it made operational via embedded developmental practices like Roca's peacekeeping circles or the Sustainable Food Lab's learning journeys.\n\nBalancing advocacy and inquiry. All change requires passionate advocates. But advocates often become stuck in their own views and become ineffective in engaging others with different views. This is why effective system leaders continually cultivate their ability to listen and their willingness to inquire into views with which they do not agree. \"Leading with real inquiry\" is easy to say, but it constitutes a profound developmental journey for passionate advocates. As collaborative networks grow in sophistication, they learn how to institutionalize the balance of advocacy and inquiry. For example, the Sustainable Food Lab has a great many passionate advocates. Recognizing that passionate advocacy can put others on the defensive (even though they may agree with what is being advocated), the Lab's NGO-Business steering committee declared that all major meetings would be \"no pitch zones,\" safe spaces where people can think together instead of engaging others in their own agendas.\n\nEngaging people across boundaries. We often are most comfortable with those with whom we share a common history and views. But operating within our comfort zones will never lead to engaging the range of actors needed for systemic change  whether it is the police for Roca or the multinational food corporations for the NGO founders of the Sustainable Food Lab. Though always challenging, reaching across boundaries can have immense payoffs. \"Innovation often only comes from seeing a system from different points of view,\" says Winslow.\n\nLetting go. System leaders need to have a strategy, but the ones who are most effective learn to \"follow the energy\" and set aside their strategy when unexpected paths and opportunities emerge. In the Sustainable Food Lab there are many companies that have become leaders who had little prior commitment to sustainable agriculture until artful system leaders helped them see a bigger picture. In one case, an internal corporate advocate for \"pro-poor\" business practices had made little progress. When she talked to her vice president about the plight of the rural poor, he was sympathetic but responded that this was the work of charities and she should reach out to their corporate foundation. A colleague pointed out her boss's deep concern about the long-term supply of important products and the implicit alignment with her concerns. When she showed the vice president how the company might be unable to source critical food products if it didn't invest in the well-being of farming communities, he said, \"Why didn't you just tell me that if we don't do these things we won't have product on the shelf?\" Today, the company is a global leader in sustainable food supply chain innovations. \"Once I could let go of my advocacy for the poor,\" she says, \"I discovered how to help my busy managers see the problem in a way they could get their heads around.\"\n\nBuilding one's own toolkit. The variety of helpful tools and approaches available today is large and growing, and system leaders should be knowledgeable about what is available. In our work, the tools we use regularly come from a variety of places, including a few mentioned here: the \"five disciplines\" approach to systems thinking and organizational learning, Theory U and Presencing, Appreciative Inquiry, Immunity to Change, Roca's peacekeeping circles, and the Change Labs and scenario planning of Reos Partners. Recently, several of us have started a process of organizing these tools to provide an integrated toolkit for systemic change. But it is important to remember that building a toolkit is more than just putting arrows in your quiver. It is about learning over time, through disciplined practice, how to become an archer.\n\nWorking with other system leaders. Developing the capabilities needed to become a more effective system leader is hard work. It needs to happen in difficult settings and under pressure to deliver tangible results. It is nave, even for the most accomplished system leader, to think that he or she can do it alone. We know of no examples where effective system leaders achieved broad-scale success without partners. You need partners who share your aspirations and challenges and who can help you face difficult changes while you also attend to your own ongoing personal development  balancing task time with time for reflection, action, and silence. You need to engage with colleagues who are at different stages in their own developmental journeys. And you need help letting the unexpected emerge amid urgency and time pressure. Connecting with others who are also engaged in this journey can help lighten the load and foster the patience needed when organizations or systems seem to be changing at a slower rate than you yourself are changing.\n\nDawn Awakening\n\nWe believe system leadership is critical for the times in which we live, but the ideas behind it are actually quite old. About twenty-five hundred years ago Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu eloquently expressed the idea of individuals who catalyze collective leadership:\n\n\nThe wicked leader is he whom the people despise. \nThe good leader is he whom the people revere.\n\nThe real question today is, Is there any realistic hope that a sufficient number of skilled system leaders will emerge in time to help us face our daunting systemic challenges? We believe there are reasons for optimism. First, as the interconnected nature of core societal challenges becomes more evident, a growing number of people are trying to adopt a systemic orientation. Although we have not yet reached a critical mass of people capable of seeing that a systemic approach and collective leadership are two sides of the same coin, a foundation of practical know-how is being built.\n\nSecond, during the last thirty years there has been an extraordinary expansion in the tools available to support system leaders; we've touched on a few of them in this article. We have observed numerous instances where the strategic use of the right tool, at the right time, and with the right spirit of openness, can shift by an order of magnitude the ability of stakeholders to create collective success. With the right shifts in attention, networks of collaboration commensurate with the complexity of the problems being addressed emerge and previously intractable situations begin to respond to interventions.\n\nLast, there is a broad, though still largely unarticulated, hunger for real change processes. This is why a person like Mandela strikes such a resonant chord. There is a widespread suspicion that the strategies being used to solve our most difficult problems are too superficial to get at the deeper sources of those problems. This can easily lead to a sense of fatalism  a quiet desperation that our social, biological, economic, and political systems will continue to drift toward chaos and dysfunction. But it can also cause people to be more open to new paths. Compared to even a few years ago, we find that many leaders today are exploring new approaches that move beyond the superficial to ignite and guide deeper change. Organizations and initiatives like those described in this article have succeeded because of a growing awareness that the inner and outer dimensions of change are connected. As our awakening continues, more and more system leaders who catalyze collective leadership will emerge.\n\nPeter Senge is a senior lecturer and director of the Center for Organizational Learning at MIT Sloan School of Management.

        "title":"Managing Up - The Grantwriter's Dilemma",
        "content":"(Allison Shirk is a freelance grantwriter based in the Puget Sound region. In her last article, she provided ten tips to help you get more out of your grantwriter's time.\n\nGood grantwriters have a unique perspective with respect to nonprofit organizations: We know what grantmakers want to hear and we know what we'd like to be able to put into grant proposals. But when conspicuous gaps begin to show up in proposals, what should you the grantwriter do? Here are six elements of a good proposal that often are missing or inadequate, and some resources to help you and your employer/client address the problems they might be hiding.\n\n1. Mission Statement:Does the organization's mission statement cause you to scratch your head? I've seen mission statements that fill an entire page and mission statements that no longer reflect the priorities and/or activities of an organization. Unfortunately, like an old quilt, board members tend to become attached to the mission statement they know, so proceed gently. Here are a few good resources about the art of the mission statement you can share with the board when the time is right: 1) how to create an effective mission statement; 2) the one-sentence mission statement; 3) eight words can be effective, too.\n\n2. Board of Director Affiliations:When funders look at a board roster, they typically are assessing both the size and quality of the board. When they ask for \"affiliations,\" they want to know the name of the company or organization where a board member works, or, if retired, most recently worked. For bonus points, feel free to describe the particular competencies (e.g., financial expertise, knowledge of IT systems, fundraising experience) that individual board members bring to the table. When a board member balks at providing information for this part of the proposal, explain why the funder wants to know and be sure to let the hesitant board member know that personal contact information is not part of the deal.\n\n3. Strategic Plan:Funders want to know that an organization is not just focused on its immediate needs but has a vision for the next five to ten years, a strategy to achieve that vision, and a plan to get there. So what can you, the grantwriter, do when an application asks for a strategic plan and the organization doesn't have one? You can start by sharing with leadership the Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool, a self-assessment instrument developed by the Marguerite Casey Foundation to help nonprofits identify their capacity-related challenges and establish capacity-building goals. Then write about the process the organization has embarked on to identify those challenges and develop a plan to address them.\n\n4. Budgets:The best organizational (and program) budget includes all the standard income and expense items across three columns last year's actuals, this year's estimated, and next year's projected and also explains any major changes or red flags in the narrative. (Remind the finance team that a budget is as much a part of the \"story\" the organization wants to tell as the narrative.) The Foundation Center's GrantSpace is a great one-stop shop for budgeting basics, sample budgets, and other budgeting resources.\n\n5. Demographic Data:All nonprofits, but especially service-delivery organizations, should have a centralized database to store important data on their constituents, volunteers, partners, donors, grant opportunities, and so on. The nonprofit resource portal 501 Commonsoffers a nice assessment tool to help organizations evaluate their database needs (and lots of other good stuff). And if the thought of providing demographic data and case studies to funders causes senior management to break out in a cold sweat, have them read this articleabout case-management tools from the folks at Idealware.\n\n6. Evaluation:Once you know who (in the aggregate) the organization serves, the next step is to find out whether those services are making a difference. Organizations should start with the basics you might want to suggest that leadership consider implementing a constituent-satisfaction survey. An easy way to approach such an objective is to choose one month out of the year during which every person who walks through the door is asked to fill out a survey. Then take it to the next level. Once you get the hang of them, logic models are a great way to understand the relationship between community needs and service provision. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation offers a free downloadable guidein the Knowledge Center of its Web site that provides practical assistance to nonprofits engaged in the logic-modeling process. You might also want to check out the fee-based four-part webinar series on outcomes thinking and managementoffered by the Foundation Center.\n\nRegardless of the particular challenge or challenges you face in crafting a grant proposal that will get funders' attention andprovide them with the information they require, be sure to always present yourself to senior management as an excellent source of knowledge and helpful resources. And remember: To effectively tell the story of an organization, you need to develop good relationships and an open, two-way communications channel with key board members and every manager and senior leader in the organization.\n\nWhat kind of challenges have you encountered as a grantwriter looking to craft a compelling proposal for a well-meaning but less-than-organized client? Have any good resources you can share? We'd love to hear them. Use the comments section at PhilanTopic....\n\n-- Allison Shirk\n\nFreelance grantwriter Allison Shirk provides diplomatic advice about how to target the problems in a client's proposal and, perhaps, the organization itself....",

        "title":"Defusing the Child Obesity Bomb",
        "content":"Ask a thousand doctors what the single greatest health challenge facing America's children today is and most won't need to think twice: Childhood obesity. In the past twenty years, the number of overweight children has tripled, and epidemiologists warn of an impending epidemic of obesity-related problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and joint and sleep disorders.\n\nBut as the medical community continues to disseminate this message and national statistics make the problem clearer, a bona fide public health mystery is shaping up  one whose solution may come from an unexpected field, not traditionally focused on kids' nutrition or physical health.\n\nWhile America has been shining a light on the physical side of the obesity equation, startlingly little attention has been paid to the underlying emotional roots of the problem. Perhaps that's because we as a society tend to see excess weight as a purely physical issue. But for clinical experts in the field of emotional health, the link between stress and eating has long been clear. For kids who may have trouble verbalizing their feelings or emotional state, overeating and overindulgence in high-fat foods are common responses to stress or depression. Child psychiatrists, child development specialists, and charities that work with kids in crisis observe this phenomenon every day at a grassroots level, as an increasing number of kids are brought to our doors suffering from both emotional issues and the physical and social burdens of being overweight.\n\nOften, even professionals find it difficult to tell which is cause and which is effect. Children under stress overeat, which can lead to teasing, bullying, even social isolation, which in turn can lead to more seeking of refuge in food or other unhealthy behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse. Or the cycle can start with an overweight child who finds him or herself shunned by a society ultra-attuned to physical \"perfection,\" leading to feelings of inferiority, self-loathing, and despair.\n\nCould a rising tide of stressors on children be the \"missing half\" of the obesity equation? While more study and research are needed to determine how big a role childhood stressors play, both anecdotal evidence from the treatment field and surveys on the emotional state of American children indicating rising pressures on today's kids suggest a need for closer scrutiny. Under the direction of the KidsPeaceLee Salk Center for Research, a national survey of 1,023 American children between the ages of ten and thirteen found youngsters reporting levels of stress and traditionally adult fears that would have been unimaginable just a generation ago. Consider these findings:\n\n\n\n\n\n54 percent fear they may contract AIDS;\n\n\n\nFour in ten children as young as ten believe they may fall into the traps of early pregnancy, unwed parenthood, drugs, or alcohol;\n\n\n\n45 percent fear they will be physically or sexually abused;\n\n\n\n51 percent are worried about their own deaths;\n\n\n\nIn a country where happiness and its pursuit are virtual birthrights written into our founding documents and cultural DNA, nearly half (47 percent) say they are afraid they might be unhappy in life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, children have also had to contend with the emotional aspects of terror attacks in New York, London, and Madrid; horrific school shootings in several communities; snipers in Washington, D.C., and Ohio; and disasters such as hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita. Is it any wonder that the psychic toll of life today is affecting our kids emotionally as well as physically? While no one thinks twice when adults have a bad day at the office or go through a particularly painful breakup and have an extra mug of beer in the local tavern or an extra pint of chocolate macadamia madness from their freezer, the role of emotions and stressors in childhood obesity is almost absent from the popular national debate. But the truth is: It's not only what our kids are eating...sometimes, it what's eating our kids.\n\nSo what should we do? The first thing, obviously, is for public health officials and health philanthropy officers to examine more closely the role of emotions and stresses on modern childhood obesity and be prepared to commit significant resources to research and efforts designed to better understand and fight both the physical and emotional causes of the epidemic. One such approach is already in the early phases of testing and is gaining early advocates from important quarters. KidsPeace, a 124-year-old national children's charity, recently launched a two-part initiative to provide children with free problem-solving resources via a Web site, www.TeenCentral.net, and get America's parents to spend more time preparing and eating home-cooked meals with their kids so they can monitor not just what goes into their mouths, but what comes out as well.\n\nProviding stress-reduction resources and encouraging families to discuss day-to-day issues over a healthy, home-cooked meal (which research demonstrates to be an effective venue for communication and a good predictor of reduced future incidence of physical and behavioral problems) has prompted support from child expert Dr. Alvin Poussaint \"because it not only helps kids to eat healthily but also gives them tools to overcome the underlying emotional reasons that can lead to overeating -- a two-sided approach you don't normally read about in the newspapers.\" Dr. Lewis P. Lipsitt, founder of the Brown University Center for the Study of Human Development and perhaps the world's leading child-development expert, calls it \"a step forward in the fight against the widespread appearance of childhood obesity. By encouraging Americans to eat healthier meals together with kids and take the time to get more deeply into their lives and help them with problems, we can work toward a nation of happier  and healthier  kids and families.\"\n\nAs we approach the end of Mental Health Month and National Family Month (extending from Mother's Day to Father's Day), during which families are encouraged to spend more time together, we urge families, public health officials, and philanthropic foundations to take a new look at a problem that seems to be intensifying despite the good, albeit one-sided, efforts being made by so many. As a nation, let's start taking more seriously not just what goes into the mouths of babes, but what is coming out of them, and let's all work together to defuse the childhood obesity bomb.\n\nC.T. O'Donnell II is president & CEO of KidsPeace, the National Center for Kids Overcoming Crisis, a 124-year-old national children's charity that helps thousands of young people at sixty-three centers nationwide overcome traumas, abuse, neglect, eating disorders, and other emotional and physical problems.\n\nAsk a thousand doctors what the single greatest health challenge facing America's children today is and most won't need to think twice: Childhood obesity.

        "title":"The Promise of Lean Experimentation",
        "content":"The work of innovation can be slow and cumbersome  particularly in the social sector. But by adopting a model that is increasingly common in the business world, nonprofit organizations can launch, test, and implement new programs and services more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe founders of Worldreader embraced a culture of lean experimentation from day one. Instead of spending significant amounts of time and money launching a full-fledged platform, they developed the smallest-scale version of the platform they could muster (their MVP) and tested it in the field. In that experiment, which began in March 2010, they introduced Amazon Kindle e-readers to sixteen sixth-graders in Ayenyah, Ghana. The Worldreader team hypothesized that the kids would embrace the e-readers, that they would read more, and that their literacy rates would increase.\n\nFocusing on a single school may seem terribly inefficient. But this high-touch MVP approach (sometimes called a \"concierge MVP\" in lean parlance) enabled Worldreader to find holes in its platform and troubleshoot problems before investing more time and resources in the initiative. The Worldreader team saw, for example, that the screens on the Kindles kept breaking because kids were sitting on the devices during recess. \"We taught students how to care for e-readers,\" says David Risher, co-founder and president of Worldreader. \"And we took the broken screens to the Kindle factory and asked [people at Amazon] to make the next generation of Kindles more durable  and they did.\"\n\nThe most important test of Worldreader's rapid experimentation approach came in late 2011, when the organization faced a critical challenge: the proliferation of basic-feature mobile phones  what we now, in the era of smartphones, call \"dumb phones\"  across the developing world created an opening for Worldreader to expand far beyond its incremental Kindle-based growth model. How could it take advantage of that opportunity?\n\nSome nonprofits confronted with an opportunity of this kind might shift into a strategic planning mode. They would start by conducting a series of internal debates about what the \"right\" strategy is, and then they would focus on developing work plans, board presentations, and funding proposals. Worldreader followed a different course. Instead of launching a grand planning and development process, the organization set up a small experiment to test a critical hypothesis  the \"riskiest hypothesis,\" as lean practitioners call it  of the proposed mobile strategy: Would children in the countries targeted by Worldreader actually read books on a basic phone? To answer that question, the Worldreader team partnered with an app developer that had already created a basic-phone reading app. The MVP version of Worldreader Mobile consisted of nothing more than lists of books and a simple text reader. It had no book covers, descriptions, ratings, comments, or bookmarks. But it had just enough functionality to allow the team to test their hypothesis.\n\nAlmost immediately, as it turned out, thousands of users downloaded the app and began using it. Only at that point  after the experiment had verified the hypothesis regarding user demand  did Worldreader enter a formal contract with its app developer and begin to make improvements to the product. Today, more than 185,000 users per month read books on the Worldreader mobile platform. Continuous rapid experimentation, along with a focus on building solutions that work for children and their families, has made that kind of growth possible.\n\nThe Art of Lean\n\nIn our work, we regularly interact with leaders of social purpose organizations. When they first hear about lean, they often say, \"Of course I run a lean organization. I run a nonprofit.\" But there is a world of difference between being lean and being frugal. Most nonprofit leaders believe that they have to be frugal: they pay low salaries, rely on donated goods, and work in cheaply furnished offices. Being lean goes far beyond cost-cutting, however. The lean process enables organizations to speed up and focus experimentation in order to reduce wasted effort. Many organizations spend a great deal of time and resources on building solutions that don't end up achieving their intended impact. Lean accelerates the process of weeding out ineffective ideas and helps quickly validate ideas that show real promise.\n\nToday, the dominant mode of operation in the nonprofit sector puts a premium on strategic planning. It emphasizes processes that generate multiyear plans that cover  often in elaborate detail  a variety of tactics, roles, and outcomes. The old adage \"plan your work and work your plan\" captures the spirit of this approach. Planning is important, of course. But by its nature, it discourages experimentation and risk-taking. The emergence of strategic philanthropy has reinforced this emphasis on planning. Under that model, funders encourage nonprofits to propose specific tactics for every desired outcome and to adhere to those tactics over multiple years. The strategic philanthropy model works well for problems with clear, proven solutions, but it often doesn't work for problems that require new approaches.\n\nThe lean model reinvents the traditional strategic planning process. In effect, it offers a new adage to follow: \"Plan your tests and test your plans.\" Lean practitioners don't enumerate the precise tactics that they will use because they don't know in advance which ones will be successful. Instead, they run many small tests and adjust their efforts after discovering what works (and what doesn't). Done well, lean helps organizations innovate more efficiently, build new services that meet the needs of their constituents, and develop disruptive solutions to seemingly intractable problems. Lean can be particularly effective as a means of testing and validating revenue models that have the potential to create sustainable, long-term funding streams.\n\nThe adoption of rapid experimentation has been slower in the social sector than in the business sector (for reasons that we will explore below). Yet there are a growing number of nonprofits that use lean to support innovation in education, health care, international development, and other fields within the social sector.\n\nThe Origins of Lean\n\nTo understand the lean method  and its applicability to the nonprofit sector  it helps to understand its origins in the for-profit sector. Part of a broad revolution in the business world, lean belongs to a set of innovation and process improvement methods that also includes Six Sigma, which managers at Motorola developed to enable error reduction; Agile, a flexible and iterative approach to software development; and Human-Centered Design, a solution-building process created by leaders at the design firm IDEO.\n\nLean has two distinct strains: \"lean production\" (also known as \"lean manufacturing\"), a structured method first developed by Toyota more than twenty-five years ago that applies to complex processes like manufacturing, logistics, and health services; and \"lean startup,\" a set of principles and practices developed in Silicon Valley over the past decade that help entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs launch new products and services. Think of lean production as a way to maximize the efficiency and impact of a good idea, and think of lean startup as a way to figure out whether an idea is worth pursuing in the first place. Although the two strains developed separately and have distinct processes, they share a commitment to identifying clear hypotheses, conducting rapid experiments, and developing new product or service models in response to experimental data.\n\nOver the past decade, several developments  increased global competition, accelerated technological change, the emergence of big data  have forced nearly every major company to adopt rapid, data-driven experimentation methods in most aspects of their operations. Today, when you buy a pair of stretch pants at H&M or download a new iPhone app or make a purchase from Amazon or click a link on Facebook, you are generating data for a series of experiments that will inform how companies make their next strategic decision. Companies that have incorporated rapid experimentation into their operations range from large corporations like General Electric, Target, 3M, and Xerox to high-growth start-ups like Dropbox, Etsy, and Upworthy.\n\nThe Elements of Lean\n\nThe lean process, as it applies to the business world, has several core components. We have adapted those components to form a model that suits the way that organizations operate in the social sector. Here we will list the components in the order that they might occur in a typical lean experimentation project. But keep in mind that lean is more circular than it is linear and the sequencing of components in any given experiment will vary. (See \"The Lean Experimentation Process\" graphic below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeation and analysis. With your target constituents in mind (or, better yet, with your constituents in the same room), generate ideas for programs and solutions that you think might solve their problems or help them achieve their aspirations. These ideas are what we call \"value hypotheses.\" As you develop such ideas, analyze similar programs and solutions that already exist and figure out how your approach might improve on those offerings. (In the business world, that process is called \"competitive differentiation.\")\n\nConstituent discovery. Get out of your office and listen to the people you hope to serve. Through surveys and one-on-one conversations, find out what your constituents truly need and want. Put your value hypotheses in front of constituents and observe how they respond to those ideas. (In the business world, this process is called \"customer discovery.\") Done well, constituent discovery will bring to light ideas that you hadn't considered, and those ideas in turn should lead you back to the ideation phase. Ideation and constituent discovery should complement each other in a rapid feedback loop.\n\nBuilding. Determine the one or two \"riskiest hypotheses\" that apply to your idea. A risky hypothesis, in this context, is an assumption that is critical to the success of your idea  an assumption that may, however, prove to be invalid. In the lean process, you should focus your attention on the riskiest hypotheses. To test those hypotheses, develop an MVP (that is, a basic prototype of your idea). Also create a rough financial model for your idea that covers cost estimates and potential revenue sources. In many cases, your MVP will be a small-scale version of your program or service. (One common lean tactic is to customize and test pre-built products. This approach is widespread in the technology world, where there has been a proliferation of ready-to-use tools for developing apps, social platforms, and the like.) Another option is to build a \"paper MVP\"  a lean tool that dramatically reduces the cost of testing demand for a program. A paper MVP can take the form of a simple flyer about a not-yet-built program, for example, or a basic online sign-up page for a prospective service.\n\nTesting. Design a plan to validate (or invalidate) your riskiest hypotheses. Then roll out your MVP to a group of constituents and collect data on how they react to it. Be sure to test the MVP in a way that will provide data on metrics that pertain to those hypotheses. Avoid focusing on vanity metrics that might give you feel-good results but don't actually help you validate or invalidate an idea.\n\nResponding to data. Analyze the results of your test. Did your MVP appeal to fewer people than you had hoped it would? Did it encounter unforeseen logistical challenges? Did you charge a price for it that ended up being too high?\n\nIf your data show that you have a flop on your hands, hit the reset button and begin the experimentation process again before investing more resources in your idea. In the lean startup field, that's called a \"pivot.\"\n\nIf your data show promise, use feedback from the test to build a better iteration of your idea. Then test that version of the idea and continue iterating and testing the idea until you have verified that it will deliver its intended value. We call this process the \"build-test-respond\" cycle. (It's a variation on the \"build-measure-learn\" cycle used in the lean startup model.)\n\nScaling up. Once you have an idea that works, use the data that you have gathered during the constituent discovery and testing phases to get buy-in  from your board, your staff, and your funders  for implementing the idea more widely. As you scale up, continue to run experiments on ways to increase efficiency and to create additional value for your constituents.\n\nThe Practice of Lean: CHIRLA\n\nThe Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) provides a textbook case of how an organization can use lean to identify promising service models. CHIRLA serves people who confront barriers related to language, discrimination, undocumented status, poverty, and limited access to technology. In 2014, the organization was seeking to develop new services that would meet the needs of its community, significantly increase its membership, and provide financial sustainability. (In particular, it sought to create services that would generate at least as much income as they cost to provide.) Instead of devoting large amounts of time and money to implementing one or two ideas  ideas that may or may not have worked  CHIRLA leaders launched a lean experimentation process. Over the course of just a few months, they were able to test the viability of more than a dozen potential services.\n\nAs part of an ideation and analysis phase, CHIRLA leaders drew on their deep experience with serving constituents to gain a sense of what those constituents might want or need. Using that insight, they developed a list of more than two dozen offerings that they thought had the potential to provide significant value in a financially sustainable way. The list included financial services (such as prepaid debit cards for unbanked immigrants), legal services, English classes, prescription discount cards, low-cost international phone cards, and health insurance products. The CHIRLA team then did market research to learn about similar services that other organizations were already offering.\n\nA building phase came next. The CHIRLA team chose fourteen of the proposed services and developed paper MVPs for them. Instead of building a full working version of any of those offerings, the team developed flyers that described each potential service. For most services, the riskiest hypothesis hinged on a simple question: Would people actually sign up for them  and would they pay a price that would make them sustainable? The flyers made the services tangible and allowed the CHIRLA team to begin assessing how much demand there might be for each offering.\n\nIn the following phase of its work, the CHIRLA team engaged in both constituent discovery and testing. The team developed a survey that combined general questions with MVP-specific questions that focused on determining the viability of their ideas for new services. Rosamaria Segura, membership coordinator at CHIRLA, led the constituent discovery process. She delved into the lives of local immigrants to understand their needs and aspirations. In each constituent interview, she also tested the riskiest hypotheses for six to eight service ideas. \"Inviting our constituents to help us discover what services they really needed was a game-changer,\" Segura says. \"As the data came in, we responded to the feedback, reconfigured the surveys, and quickly got a sense of whether our ideas were worth pursuing and where our blind spots were.\"\n\nUltimately, Segura completed more than a hundred constituent discovery interviews. She and her colleagues now had data on which services people would or would not sign up for. The work of responding to the data began almost immediately. CHIRLA leaders concluded that ten of the proposed services either didn't have sufficient demand or would require significant iteration before further testing could take place. Four of the proposed services, meanwhile, had strong demand and merited further exploration. In addition, a review of the interview data led the CHIRLA team to explore several new service ideas.\n\nOne of those ideas involved offering classes to help people in the CHIRLA community pass the written driver's license exam in California. The state had recently passed a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses. According to state records, however, 70 percent of those who take the exam in a language other than English fail in their first attempt. CHIRLA leaders, noting that many undocumented immigrants would fall into that category, saw a new need that their organization could fill and developed a plan to offer classes on passing the exam and moved quickly to test the viability of that idea.\n\nInitially, CHIRLA staff members thought that they might need multiple sessions to prepare immigrants for the exam. But instead of building a curriculum around that hypothesis, they designed a simple three-hour course  an MVP, in other words  and ran trial classes for sixty constituents. After that single three-hour session, nearly 90 percent of participants passed a mock version of the driver's-license exam. Clearly, a multiple-session course wouldn't be necessary. Through the MVP test, CHIRLA also learned that demand was high for the classes and that people would pay to gain access to them. On the basis of those findings, CHIRLA invested resources in curriculum development, a train-the-trainer program, and marketing materials for the new offering.\n\nLean experimentation enabled CHIRLA to identify a program model that had three crucial features: high constituent demand, demonstrated impact, and financial sustainability. Today, the organization continues to improve the driver's-license exam class and plans to scale up the model in order to serve thousands of immigrants.\n\nVarieties of Lean\n\nOrganizations throughout the nonprofit sector have begun to apply the lean method to their operations. Although lean can help organizations to test and improve a wide array of programs and processes, it is particularly effective as a way to optimize certain core activities.\n\nDemand testing of new ideas. Lean can help an organization determine whether anyone will take advantage of a given program or service. Using lean, nonprofits can test assumptions about the pain points, needs, and aspirations of their constituents.\n\nGuideStar, an organization that gathers and shares information about nonprofits, recently created a user advisory panel that includes about two hundred and fifty members. The purpose of the panel is to provide rapid, actionable feedback that will help the organization decide which innovations are worth exploring. In its first two months of working with the panel, GuideStar called on users to help test four MVPs, along with ten ideas that were at the concept stage. Among the products tested were a mobile app, a Charity Check widget, and a product to help organizations prepare their federal tax forms. After examining feedback from the user panel, GuideStar is moving forward on the best ideas and is altering or scrapping the others.\n\nShort-term outcome testing. Through lean, an organization can rapidly test strategies for achieving clearly defined short-term outcomes  outcomes that relate to school attendance, reading rates, job placement, health improvement behaviors, and the like. A/B testing, in which an organization tests alternative approaches on randomized samples of constituents, is a critical tool of lean outcome testing.\n\nAt a school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, investigators conducted a rapid experiment to test the impact of parental involvement on student performance. In an experiment that involved A/B testing, the investigators arranged to send some parents of high-school students text and email messages to notify them that their kids had missed an assignment. As it turns out, the students whose parents received the messages experienced performance improvements that were much larger than the gains shown by students whose parents didn't receive such messages.\n\nProcess efficiency improvements. Lean production, the process improvement strain of lean, can help an organization improve the flow of a process by identifying and eliminating waste. In that way, lean can streamline a program and increase its impact.\n\nThe American Red Cross used practices from the Toyota Production System (TPS)  a precursor to lean production  to improve in-the-field training for its disaster volunteers. Through that effort, the organization was able to reduce the time required to register and train volunteers from 3 hours and 45 minutes to just thirty minutes. Similarly, the Food Bank for New York City used TPS-based practices to test alternative approaches to serving, seating, and line management. As a result, the organization cut the average wait time for its patrons from 1 hour and 30 minutes to just eighteen minutes.\n\nRevenue growth. Given its roots in the business world, the lean method is particularly well suited to testing new revenue-generating strategies. Lean, for example, can help an organization evaluate its plans for fundraising optimization, membership growth, social ventures, and program fee changes.\n\nEnvironment America is a federation of state-based advocacy groups. Before the start of each major campaign, a small team of canvassers from the organization tests a variety of pitch messages. The purpose of those messages is both to recruit supporters and to generate income for the organization. Following that initial test, members of the team analyze metrics that include the percentage of people who listen to a pitch, the percentage of people who make a contribution, and the average contribution amount. Using those data, they determine which pitch is most effective, develop materials to support that pitch, and then train hundreds of staff members to use it.\n\nCitizen organizing. Lean enables advocacy groups to experiment with various campaigns and campaign tactics. Through lean, such groups can rapidly test which media channels and which messages actually move people to take action.\n\nSumOfUs, a corporate watchdog group that organizes citizens through online petitions, has more than five million members. Each week, the organization conducts micro-experiments to evaluate dozens of email-based corporate accountability campaigns. It ends up shelving more than 80 percent of those campaigns because the experiments reveal a lack of member interest in them. Then it focuses its resources on the campaigns that its members clearly care about.\n\nThe Challenge of Lean\n\nIn 2013, Steve Blank wrote an article in Harvard Business Review titled \"Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything.\" It was a provocative title, but it was accurate enough: rapid experimentation methods have permeated the business world. So why haven't they spread as widely within the social sector? Does lean not apply as directly to social problems as it does to commercial situations?\n\nThere are, to be sure, limitations to applying lean in the social sector. It cannot replace longitudinal research. No form of rapid experimentation, for instance, can test whether an intervention aimed at kids in preschool will affect high school graduation rates. Nonprofit leaders also find it difficult to measure social impact using the kind of cold, hard numbers that lean favors. It's easy to measure revenue. It's much harder to measure, for example, the effect that a given strategy might have had on changing people's minds about a social issue. Lean, moreover, can be disruptive to existing programs and disorienting for staff members who are comfortable with established approaches to pursuing social impact. Perhaps most important, lean works best as a tool for testing and improving discrete programs and processes. It cannot serve as a master strategy, and it cannot answer fundamental questions about the theory of change that governs an organization's overarching approach.\n\nIn the business sector, companies have adopted rapid experimentation methods partly in response to increased global competition and accelerated technology change. For-profit companies that don't quickly adapt to the new environment will ultimately collapse. Organizations in the social sector are generally less vulnerable to such disruptive forces. But as these forces spread across the sector, more and more organizations are likely to adopt the lean method.\n\nFor rapid experimentation to become widespread in the social sector, funders will need to embrace new approaches to supporting innovation. Traditional funding processes for nonprofits discourage rapid experimentation by reinforcing risk aversion and an adherence to top-down planning. The rules for submitting grant proposals often require nonprofits to spell out every strategy, tactic, and outcome in a detailed timeline. In addition, many funders have adopted cumbersome grant amendment processes that inhibit efforts to test new approaches.\n\nA few pioneering foundations are trying to change this situation by explicitly funding experimentation. Contests and prizes like those funded by the Gates, Knight, and MacArthur foundations have opened up space for experimentation. The use of prizes, however, works only within very limited parameters and sometimes causes more harm than good. Fellowships, meanwhile, provide people who have an entrepreneurial mindset with an opportunity to develop and test new ideas. But that kind of individual support is rarely enough to catalyze a culture of rapid experimentation throughout an organization. Funders, therefore, should make sponsorship of lean experimentation a larger part of their ordinary grantmaking process.\n\nThe Power of Lean\n\nAll too often, the process by which nonprofit organizations develop and launch new products and programs can stretch for months or even years. The lean process, in contrast, enables teams to build and test a new approach in a matter of weeks or even days. If that approach is not effective, teams can pivot quickly. If the approach needs improvement, they can undertake new iterations rapidly. And if the approach shows promise, they can cite data to prove its effectiveness so that funders can invest in it with confidence.\n\nVarious tools are now available that will help nonprofit leaders to engage in rapid experimentation. But at its core, the lean process is simple. In 2014, at a Lean for Social Good Summit in San Francisco, one of us (Steve Ma) saw just how quickly that process can unfold. Dominique Aubry, who is now president of Lean Leadership Inc., spoke about the lean process for an hour. She then broke participants into teams and had them develop solutions to specific problems. Next, after they had spent two hours refining their ideas, Aubry told them to leave the conference facility, hit the streets, and interview relevant constituents about their proposed solutions. In just one day, participants went through ideation, constituent discovery, building, and testing  followed by iterating, testing again, and iterating again.\n\nIf you're ready to make the leap into lean, start by testing it out. You don't need to hire consultants who are experts in lean. (We are consultants, so trust us: You don't need consultants.) You don't need to hold a board vote about implementing lean. And you don't need special grant funding or funder buy-in to run lean experiments. You do need buy-in from your team to embrace rapid experimentation, and you need to be willing to look at the data that you gather and to change your approach accordingly. Once you're ready, get out of your office and talk to your constituents. Identify your value hypotheses, build MVPs fast, and test them in the field. Then respond to the results  and iterate.\n\nPeter Murray is president of Accelerate Change, a nonprofit incubator that uses lean experimentation to help membership-based organizations engage constituents and increase earned revenue.

        "content":"Federal prisons are dangerously overcrowded, and the only way to address the problem and lower costs and rates of recidivism is through a combination of reforms, a report from the Urban Institute, the Public Welfare Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations finds. According to the report, Stemming the Tide: Strategies to Reduce the Growth and Cut the Cost of the Federal Prison System (63 pages, PDF), the federal prison population grew from fewer than 25,000 in 1980 to more than 219,000 in 2012 largely thanks to the meting out of long sentences for drug-related crimes. With high-security and medium-security facilities operating at 51 percent and 47 percent above capacity, respectively, the report argues that it is becoming increasingly difficult to prevent prison violence, provide programs designed to reduce recidivism, maintain prison infrastructure, and lower costs to taxpayers. The most effective way to reduce overcrowding, the reports authors suggest, is to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses. Indeed, the report suggests that by also retroactively applying the Fair Sentencing Act to crack cocaine offenders and extending opportunities for early release to those who participate in programs designed to prevent recidivism, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons could save up to $3 billion over ten years.",

Globally, the Library has millions of exchanges with users through in-person visits, circulation requests, and online or phone conversations about research questions. Second only to the University's homepage, the Library website is perhaps the most visible face of our University to the world and the most tangible demonstration of its core values: excellence and access. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The University and the Library cannot exist without each other. Because the Library -- in both its physical and virtual forms -- is ubiquitous in the everyday lives of faculty, students, administrative staff, scholarly researchers, and the general public worldwide, it is difficult to make a case for its role in sustaining the academic preeminence of the University except by imagining our University and our world without it. There is simply no great University without a great Library. The Library is the heart and circulatory system of our research and instructional mission; it is the essential pump that takes in the life-blood of learning and circulates it throughout the campus community and beyond our walls to our furthest public extremities; it makes research happen; it makes learning possible; it draws new learning back into the system only to generate more learning and send it out to circulate again. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The Commission has concluded that the centrality of the Library to the range of learning and research at Berkeley warrants a serious strategy of major reinvestment. The Library, aided by the campus administration and the Academic Senate, should devise a detailed execution plan for this reinvestment, along the lines of the Commission's recommendations, coupled with a plan of both cost-saving and revenue-generating measures. To face the challenges of the next twenty years the Library should align its organizational structure and its institutional culture with the rapidly changing needs of faculty research and student learning. The campus community as a whole should assume the financial and intellectual responsibility of active partnership in this important endeavor. Because the health of the entire academic enterprise depends upon the Library, there should be no higher priority for campus investment and no greater responsibility for the Campus Administration and the Academic Senate than the effective stewardship of the Library.",

Chinese authorities are determined to restore consumer confidence in Chinese manufactured goods, but in fact may find this easier than expected: despite the uproar over dangerous toys and products, Chinese exports continue to expand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In short, the price is right: consumers' demand for low prices at their local big-box retailer and increasing global competition continue to drivemanufacturing to China, in spite of the social costs.

The report details for the first time the vast money, influence and deceptive marketing techniques behind the rhetoric in the campaign to repeal the tax.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It reveals how 18 families worth a total of $185.5 billion have financed and coordinated a 10-year effort to repeal the estate tax, a move that would collectively net them a windfall of $71.6 billion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The report profiles the families and their businesses, which include the families behind Wal-Mart, Gallo wine, Campbell's soup, and Mars Inc., maker of M&amp;Ms. Collectively, the list includes the first- and third-largest privately held companies in the United States, the richest family in Alabama and the world's largest retailer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; These families have sought to keep their activities anonymous by using associations to represent them and by forming a massive coalition of business and trade associations dedicated to pushing for estate tax repeal. The report details the groups they have hidden behind -- the trade associations they have used, the lobbyists they have hired, and the anti-estate tax political action committees, 527s and organizations to which they have donated heavily.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In a massive public relations campaign, the families have also misled the country by giving the mistaken impression that the estate tax affects most Americans. In particular, they have used small businesses and family farms as poster children for repeal, saying that the estate tax destroys both of these groups. But just more than one-fourth of one percent of all estates will owe any estate taxes in 2006. And the American Farm Bureau, a member of the anti-estate tax coalition, was unable when asked by The New York Times to cite a single example of a family being forced to sell its farm because of estate tax liability.",

This report provides critical new information about what has fueled the racial wealth gap and points to policy approaches that will set our country in a more equitable and prosperous direction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Looking at the same set of families over a 25-year period (1984-2009), our research offers key insight into how policy and the real, lived-experience of families in schools, communities, and at work affect wealth accumulation. Tracing the same households during that period, the total wealth gap between white and African-American families nearly triples, increasing from $85,000 in 1984 to $236,500 in 2009. To discover the major drivers behind this dramatic $152,000 increase, we tested a wide range of possible explanations, including family, labor market, and wealth characteristics. This allowed us, for the first time, to identify the primary forces behind the racial wealth gap. Our analysis found little evidence to support common perceptions about what underlies the ability to build wealth, including the notion that personal attributes and behavioral choices are key pieces of the equation. Instead, the evidence points to policy and the configuration of both opportunities and barriers in workplaces, schools, and communities that reinforce deeply entrenched racial dynamics in how wealth is accumulated and that continue to permeate the most important spheres of everyday life.",

We found that most states demanded little instruction in this area.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In casting the movement as a regional matter, or a topic significant to African-American students only, the states failed to recognize the profound national significance of the movement. Their standards and frameworks sent the message that the movement could safely be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Three years later, we see some improvement in the message that states send to their teachers and students.In some cases, states have modified and strengthened their standards. Most of the improvement, however, was captured because we widened our lens to look beyond what states required, to include resources and materialsthey offered teachers.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This 2014 report expands and improves upon our previous report in three ways. First, we invited states to self-report on their programs, processes and progress in teaching the movement.

Using data from the 1999-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we considered the following outcomes related to nutrient intakes: energy intake, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and iron. The set of health outcomes we analyzed were diabetes, general health , depression, diabetes, ADL limitations, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, cancer, reports of chest pain, gum disease, psoriasis, asthma, having had a heart attack, and a self-report of gum health.",

The unemployment rate is far lower than that of the country as a whole. Incomes are high, especially for highly educated workers. From outside this bubble, things look pretty good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  However, the bubble obscures a troubling story for many residents of the region. Income inequality is growing. Employment levels for people without a college education are far lower than before the recession. Unemployment rates for several groups of workers, including those without a college degree, remain high. Black workers and young workers were particularly hard hit by the recession, even when compared to other area residents with similar education levels. The high cost of living in the region is pushing many families to spend more than they can afford on housing, while others trade more affordable housing for long and expensive commutes. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The region has many successes worth celebrating. But broadly shared prosperity is not one of them. The region's policymakers need to address the challenges facing those who are struggling to keep their foothold in the economy. This includes ensuring all workers in the region have the skills and credentials needed by employers for current and future jobs, taking steps to make sure all working adults have enough income to support their families, and ensuring availability of affordable housing options with access to good jobs",

Since the creation of the Prize, the Rennie Center for Education Research & Policy has served as EdVestors' research partner, identifying and documenting lessons from the winning schools. This report draws upon the previous SOM case studies produced by the Rennie Center, along with interviews with school leaders, staff and students. The study identifies common themes across all four winning schools that describe the structures and strategies put in place to better serve students, as well as some of the opportunities and barriers the schools have faced in sustaining their success since winning the award. Finally, the study highlights some key lessons the leaders of these four schools view as critical to implementing the strategies and practices outlined to support students and improve outcomes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Over the past four years, a diverse group of schools have emerged as winners, including two pilot schools -- one a high school and the other an elementary school -- a traditional K-8 school and a small high school occupying one floor of the South Boston Education Complex. These schools also represent the diverse neighborhoods in Boston, including Dorchester, Roxbury, Brighton, and South Boston. Despite differences in structure, governance and grades served, all four winning schools do share some similar characteristics. First, they all experienced significant structural changes in the immediate years prior to winning the SOM Prize that provided an opportunity for reflection and strategic planning. Second, they are all relatively small schools with lower enrollments than most comparable schools with the same grade configurations in the district. Third, they are all led by experienced educators who are strong leaders with deep knowledge of the Boston Public School system. Finally, they all share common practices that have been critical to their success in improving student achievement, including: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared Leadership -- Shared Learning: Distributed leadership grounded in shared accountability between administrators and teachers toward a goal of instructional excellence and increased student achievement; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data-driven Instruction: Intentional systems to use data to drive decisions about curriculum, instruction and student supports; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Academic Rigor and Student Support: A student-centered approach that balances high academic expectations with integrated academic and developmental supports targeted to student needs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

        "content":"The need to build a more robust workforce development pipeline is evident in the hundreds of thousands of job openings in our nation's advanced manufacturing industry. Rapid technological change has created a severe skills gap, compounded by a pending wave of retirements due to the aging of the workforce.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Investment in industry-driven on-the-job training (OJT) can be an effective workforce development strategy in this economy. This brief explores one promising OJT model: the Boeing Manufacturing On-the-Job Training Project (the &quot;Boeing Project&quot;), funded by The Boeing Company and managed by the National Fund for Workforce Solutions (National Fund).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Boeing project demonstrates that a well-designed OJT initiative can be valuable for both workers and employers. The project provided insight into the best uses of on-the-job training within the workforce development system, as well as recommendations for which design elements are most likely to help programs succeed. Results show that the OJT model is well suited for creating career advancement opportunities for entry-level employees, as well as for helping workforce development partnerships build relationships with employers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Between the summer of 2012 and the spring of 2013, the Boeing OJT project placed 101 unemployed workers into training at 39 advanced manufacturing companies. Eight regional workforce industry partnerships of the National Fund provided employers with 50 percent wage subsidies during training periods of between 10 and 15 weeks. At the end of this training, employers retained 91 of those workers. Employers and employees overwhelmingly found the program beneficial, reporting high levels of satisfaction with the training experiences and the skills required.The following are the three key lessons learned from the project about the role of on-the-job training in workforce development:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;On-the-job training is well suited to customize training to the employer's specific needs, while creating career advancement opportunities for entry-level workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;On-the-job training must include clear employer incentives to consider low-skilled candidates-and to hire newly trained workers-in order to serve as an effective job placement strategy for low-skilled, unemployed adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creating on-the-job initiatives helps workforce development programs strengthen existing partnerships with employers and build new employer relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;",

        "content":"The paper uses a case study of a loan guarantee fund of $800,000 provided by the Ford Foundation to the Grameen Bank in 1981 as a framework for offering reflections on current debates within US philanthropy on accountability, support for innovation, risk taking and impact. Ford's loan guarantee fund leveraged commercial bank lending to Grameen Bank. The subsequent high rates of loan repayment by loan recipients convinced commercial bankers of the viability of Muhammad Yunus' model of lending to poor entrepreneurs unable to provide traditional loan collateral. The paper develops the concept of &quot;accountability regimes,&quot; and argues that foundations engaged in international poverty reduction are better able, institutionally, to bear risk in support of innovation than multilateral and bilateral aid organizations such as the World Bank and USAID. That said, recent interviews of a small sample of executives whose foundations fund poverty work abroad suggest ambivalent attitudes toward funding innovative and risky projects. This is attributed, in part, to high expectations on the part of foundation boards and top executives that foundation-funded programs show positive, early and measurable impact. The great diversity of the US philanthropic community, and the commitment of many foundations to important charitable activities that are not necessarily inviting of innovation, further explains a more modest investment by US philanthropy in the kind of innovative work that they are uniquely sanctioned to support. Encouraging foundations to be more open to supporting innovative initiatives, the paper next offers three operational principles, drawn mainly from the Grameen case study, which foundations might observe in their poverty reduction initiatives. These are: the strongest ideas are likely to come from individuals and organizations outside of foundations working close to the problems; long-term impact assessments should focus on achievement of administrative and policy reforms in institutions that matter in the lives of poor people and; active and early engagement with governments, the private sector and publicly-funded donors will increase the chances that new ideas, once successfully tested, will bring about systemic change.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This publication is Hauser Center Working Paper No. 44.

        "content":"Education can be a powerful tool for child welfare-involved youth to overcome their circumstances and become successful adults. Sadly, educational outcomes for young people in care are notoriously poor. Students in foster care have lower standardized test scores, and they repeat grades and are suspended much more frequently than other students. They are significantly over-represented in special education programs, change schools repeatedly and often miss substantial amounts of school. Youth who age out of foster care are more likely to drop out of high school than other young people; most do not enroll in college or other post-secondary programs, and few ever complete a college degree.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Over the last decade, child welfare agencies and advocates have begun to recognize that the students they serve need access to greater educational opportunities, and that education is critically important to child wellbeing, permanency planning and a successful transition to adulthood. In particular, best practices research has consistently identified education advocacy as an effective strategy to improve school stability and educational outcomes for this population of vulnerable youth. This report offers insights from one program, called Project Achieve, which pairs Advocates for Children of New York (&quot;AFC&quot;), a non-profit that provides education advocacy to low-income students in New York City, with local foster care and preventive services agencies. The report explains how Project Achieve works and examines its long-term impact on the children and families served by these agencies, the people who work there and the city's child welfare system itself.",

This contrasts with the declining performance of the formal sector, and underscores the sector's potential for absorbing the country's increasing labour force as more households become dependent on it. One important attribute of the sector is that it has become a major employer of the female labour force in the country. This study investigated the factors determining the participation of women in informal sector activities given a range of other available labour market options. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The results show that education is one of the important factors determining women's participation in the different categories of the labour market. The study concludes that efforts to address the problem of women's access to the labour market should focus on improving their access to education as one of the important factors for improving their human capital. Given the nature of the informal sector, and the fact that access to the labour market is an outcome of the interaction between demand and supply, addressing female participation in the sector may require addressing the demand side of the Kenyan labour market in addition to the factors expected to explain labour market participation.",

        "content":"From 1971 to 2002, the amount of weekly instruction in the arts for the average elementary school student dropped from 2 hours to 45 minutes. The editors of this new study of arts education also describe the \"arts gap\" in American education: arts education has been severely eroded in low income school districts but became more established in wealthy districts and viewed as a core value in elite private schools.\n\nThe importance of arts in the curriculum and in children's lives is not a new idea. But this book raises the question of whether \"art for art's sake\"  field trips, art and music lessons  is enough. The authors feel strongly that arts education, to be effective, must be completely integrated into the curriculum  or \"art for learning's sake.\"\n\nIn the opening chapter, education journalist Dan Weissman makes the case that integrated arts education improves education and learning. He describes his experiences and impressions after visits to integrated arts programs in Chicago, Minneapolis and Boston. Weissman uses examples from these programs to demonstrate how arts integration can strengthen education overall in these urban districts.\n\nThe second chapter, written by Madeline Grumet, a curriculum scholar and former dean of education schools at Brooklyn College and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, examines arts integrated programs and the relationship of this strategy to positive outcomes in education.\n\nCultural historian Michael Wakeford focuses in the third chapter on the history and trends of education and the arts. In chapter 4, Shirley Brice Heath, a linguistic anthropologist and researcher, and Sir Ken Robinson, an internationally recognized expert on knowledge and creativity, discuss youth arts programs from an international perspective.\n\nThe editors wrap things up in the final chapter. Nick Rabkin is the executive director of the Chicago Center for Arts Policy at Columbia College; Robin Redmund is the associate director. They report on research studies over the last 15 years that have shown significant correlations between arts education and student achievement. In order to test their hypothesis that arts integration maximizes the benefits of the arts for students, they reviewed evaluation studies of almost a dozen substantial arts education programs and selected six to investigate further. Their evaluation results are summarized in an appendix. Each chapter ends with a list of cited materials.\n\nThis book is an interesting look at how the arts can be integrated into every aspect of education, and it makes a good case for the benefits of doing so. It is very readable, especially the first chapter. Mr. Weissman's description of the impact of integrated arts education programs in those urban districts is mesmerizing. Anyone who is interested in improving education in our schools would do well to take a look at this material.\n\nFor citations to additional materials on this topic refer to the Literature of the Nonprofit Sector Online, using the subject heading \"Arts education.\"\n\nWhile the importance of arts in the curriculum and in children's lives is not a new idea, the authors raise the question of whether \"art for art's sake\"  field trips, art and music lessons  is enough, arguing for \"art for learning's sake\"  that arts education, to be effective, must be completely integrated into the curriculum....",

Editors Frances Hesselbein, editor-in-chief of Leader to Leader and founding president of the Drucker Foundation, and Marshall Goldsmith, an executive educator, have collected essays from leaders in the academic, nonprofit, corporate, and military sectors to bring a wide range of authority and experience to the issue of leadership. More importantly, the contributors to the volume are all innovative thinkers and adept at looking ahead to what leadership will and should entail in the future rather than what has worked in the past.\n\nThe result is a thorough analysis of the professional assets that drive nonprofit leadership, as well as an examination of the role of corporations in remedying global economic disparities at a time when for-profit organizations can no longer afford to promote the bottom line as their sole raison d'tre. The authors are precise, authoritative, and do a superb job of distilling their insights and opinions into compact essays that should be valuable to anyone looking to cultivate a leadership role in his or her organization.\n\nWhile the volume focuses on the traits shared by effective leaders, most notably the forward thinking that would-be leaders must cultivate in order to succeed in today's global environment, it also provides useful information on a range of topics, from the importance of true diversity (i.e., valuing a variety of viewpoints based on different perspectives rather than just \"filling quotas\") to effectively inspiring knowledge workers in a competitive environment where job security is rarely guaranteed.\n\nLeadership studies have flourished in the last decade, in part due to the staggering success of the original volume in this series. A tough act to follow, for sure, but the second volume doesn't disappoint. While the voices captured between the book's covers range from the academic to the informal, every contributor to the book puts a premium on readability and the practical applications of his or her ideas. The result is a book you'll gladly read for pleasure as well as inspiration.\n\nThe collection of essays provides a thorough analysis of the professional assets that drive nonprofit leadership, as well as an examination of the role of corporations in remedying global economic disparities at a time when for-profit organizations can no longer afford to promote the bottom line as their sole raison d'tre....",

        "title":"Meeting in the Middle: Creating the Biomedical Workforce of the Future",
        "content":"Biomedical science is advancing at a record pace and undergoing fundamental changes along the way. Divisions between various branches of biology are weakening, while connections between biology and physical science, engineering, and mathematics are strengthening. With the growth of biotechnology, applications of basic science have become increasingly commonplace. Meanwhile, clinical medicine has become more complex; clearly, many newly emerging biomedical applications can contribute to the improved practice of medicine, which philanthropic efforts can support. Unfortunately, this merging of the biological and physical, of basic and applied, generally has not been mirrored by new educational programs. Society is faced with the need for training at the interface between basic and clinical science, closing the distance between bench and bed. Given the complexities of this effort, we need to forge connections that allow appropriate experts to meet in the middle.\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute(HHMI) is answering this challenge by supporting efforts aimed at bringing students from various parts of the spectrum together to create and deploy new, innovative uses of science for medicine. Both professional (M.D.) and graduate (Ph.D.) programs offer opportunities to recruit and train a new advanced workforce. We are currently supporting several different programs to create research-intensive physician-scientists as well as medically oriented basic scientists.\n\nAlthough an increasing number of medical students have been exposed to authentic research as undergraduates, few have had opportunities to experience full-time research for periods longer than, at best, a summer. Even fewer have approached biomedically relevant research armed with disease-based knowledge of human biology. HHMI is addressing this need in two programs that make it possible for medical students to take one or two years away from formal medical training to engage in full-time research. Both programs are successfully channeling medical students into research careers.\n\nThe HHMI-NIH Research Scholarsprogram brings medical and dental students to the campus of the National Institutes of Health(NIH), houses them together in a renovated convent, and places them in NIH laboratories under the mentorship of NIH scientists. By housing the scholars together, we can provide additional activities such as a weekly seminar featuring scientists from the NIH intramural research program and HHMI investigators from our seventy-two host institutions around the nation. The scholars also form their own journal clubs and present results of their ongoing research to each other, forming intellectual and professional ties that persist long after they return to their home schools. The NIH campus, housing one of the world's largest collections of biomedical scientists, provides outstanding research opportunities for students from any medical school. This year, 161 students from seventy-six institutions competed for the forty-two places in the program.\n\nThe HHMI Research Training Fellowships for Medical Studentsprogram similarly makes it possible for medical students to take time off from their medical studies for a year of uninterrupted mentored research at any nonprofit research institution. The program allows students to pursue research programs at either their home institution or another suitable site. By working in a laboratory at their home institution, students can start a project part time before entering our program and/or continue a project after completing the program. This year, there were two hundred applications for sixty-six awards. Medical fellows will conduct research at twenty-six different institutions, and students from fourteen medical schools will be doing research at an institution other than the school in which they are matriculated.\n\nStudents from both programs are united in an annual meeting at HHMI and connections are continued at alumni organizations formed at major sites around the nation. We have assessed the outcome of these programs and have found that alumni of both programs are about as likely to pursue a career in academic medicine as students with an M.D./Ph.D. degree, and about eight times more likely than students who receive just an M.D. degree. Finally, to enable our students to initiate successful academic research careers, we have introduced an early career support program this year, open to our alumni at the start of their first full-time academic positions. The program will provide three years of flexible funding and protected time for research for newly minted faculty in their vulnerable first few independent years in the academy.\n\nOn the other side of the training divide, the new HHMI Med into Grad Initiativehas been developed to support the integration of medicine into Ph.D. graduate education. A goal of this initiative is to create a cadre of researchers who have the knowledge and skills necessary to appreciate and address clinically relevant biological problems from the perspective of basic science. The initiative has awarded $10 million to thirteen institutions to foster this integration. For example, Stanford University will initiate a Masters of Medicine program that offers a formal pre-clinical medical curriculum to students admitted to any of the institution's Ph.D. training programs. The students will have a physician co-mentor who will help them formulate clinically meaningful questions for their dissertation research. In a related but somewhat different approach, Rice University will partner with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to develop a training program for bioengineering Ph.D. students. This program will integrate courses in bioengineering, biology, and medicine; require clinical internships; and encourage jointly mentored Ph.D. projects.\n\nCommon to all of the supported programs is a vision of fundamental science being marshaled to address clinically relevant questions, usually by forming bridges between clinical and basic faculty. It is our hope that beyond graduate thesis research projects that connect bench to bed, these programs will create lasting ties between basic and clinical departments and yield a new cadre of scientists who go forward practicing and teaching collaborative science as they in turn become the faculty of the future. We anticipate that these new scientists will appreciate which biological problems are of the greatest clinical relevance and will be positioned to apply new biological knowledge to create tools for improved human health.\n\nIn summary, it is clear that modern medicine is increasingly based on science and that exciting and fulfilling new science can be applied to medicine. More programs are needed that incorporate training at the interfaces of disciplines to create lasting collaborations among diverse practitioners. Students are powerful innovators and connectors, forcing fresh ideas and practices to come together. Private philanthropy is perfectly suited to catalyze new experiments in education; the need and opportunity is there to do much more.\n\nPeter J. Brunsis vice president for grants and special programsat the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,a nonprofit medical research organization with hundreds of biomedical scientists working at the forefront of their fields.\n\nBiomedical science is advancing at a record pace and undergoing fundamental changes along the way.

In addition, Boston will suffer from the displacement of other events, including Sail Boston 2004 and the U.S. Olympic gymnastic qualifying event, and the tourism associated with them. In fact, many tourists are likely to avoid both cities during the conventions because of congestion, transportation delays, and security concerns.

        "title":"Loot: The Battle Over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World",
        "content":"In Loot: The Battle Over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World, Sharon Waxman, a former reporter for the New York Times, examines the tricky issue of antiquity acquisition and repatriation and, in the process, indicts some of the world's greatest museums for their willful and ongoing deceit about the provenance of many of the ancient works of art in their collections.\n\nAccording to Waxman, provenance of such pieces was considered secondary to their authenticity under the \"don't ask, don't tell\" regime that prevailed among curators and museum directors for decades  a lapse abetted by an incurious public. Only recently did this unofficial policy give way to strict UNESCO-brokered standards in museum acquisitions. Repatriation is of recent vintage, too, and it continues to make news as Egypt, Italy, and other nations go public with demands for the return of clearly plundered objects. Wronged nations have become media-savvy, their claims often buttressed by embarrassing evidence that museum officials  including those at New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art  were fully aware that what they were buying was indeed...loot.\n\nA reader-friendly account, Loot tells the story of such famed plunder as the Euphronios Krater, a large, exquisitely decorated, 2,500-year-old tureen that the Met returned to Italy last year, and the bust of Nefertiti. Waxman's account is enlivened by gossipy detail, helpful photographs, and expert storytelling and reporting. As background for current controversies, it also recounts the histories of such culture meccas as the Louvre  a former hunting lodge  and the Met, many of whose first antiquities came from archaeological digs sponsored by Louis Palma de Cesnola, a Civil War veteran who became U.S. consul to Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Cyprus, Cesnola planned to ship nearly four hundred artifact-laden packing crates to New York, but the ruling Ottomans got wind of his scheme and ordered that \"the U.S. consul\" be allowed to do no such thing. So Cesnola simply shipped the crates as the property of the Russian consul.\n\nCesnola, who became director of the Met, eventually collected 35,573 ancient objects, some of whose provenance remains unclear. In 1893, a German archaeologist searched for the temple and funerary chamber that Cesnola said had yielded many of his treasures. The temple, the archaeologist concluded, existed only in Cesnola's \"imaginative mind.\" The Met, Waxman says, explains this away as \"a mystery.\"\n\nFor those who haven't followed the repatriation debate  or haven't read the memoirs of certain museum directors  some sections of the book are sure to raise eyebrows. The book's section on the Met, for instance, is titled \"Tomb Robbers on Fifth Avenue,\" and in it Waxman quotes Thomas Hoving, former Met director and now confirmed \"restitutionist\":\n\n\"I bought a lot of smuggled stuff....My favorite story to get something out of Italy was to bring the children in a station wagon, put mattresses on the back in the hottest day of August and leave with this stuff under the mattress. Just before going to Customs. you'd give the kids ice cream cones. And the Customs officials in their dress whites, you can't imagine how fast they'd put you through....You did it because you wanted to boost your collection with beautiful things.\"\n\nAs others have before and since, the British Museum in 1998 declared that it no longer would buy ancient \"beautiful things\" without clear provenance  a move that Waxman applauds. In contrast, she devotes considerable space in her section on the museum to the Elgin Marbles, whose provenance is only too clear. Britain's Lord Elgin  a rescuer of priceless antiquities to some and a looter to others  never had clear authority from the ruling Ottomans to dismantle parts of the Parthenon and crowbar-out the many sculptures that wound up in the British Museum. The current revisionist view, Waxman says, is that the Elgin Marbles were removed \"to safeguard beautiful things on behalf of the world.\" But Greece now is building the New Acropolis Museum at the base of the Parthenon specifically to house, and safeguard, the Elgin Marbles, mooting any British argument that they can't be repatriated because the Greeks have no proper place for them. The real fear, Waxman says, is that repatriating them and other treasures \"would open the door to the emptying not only of the British Museum but of all the great museums of the world.\"\n\nThe British Museum also is \"home\" to the Rosetta Stone, dug up in Egypt by French soldier-laborers under the command of Napoleon and handed over to the British in the early years of the nineteenth century. No one at the time thought to ask the Egyptians if they minded. They did, and now they want it back. Nothing doing, say the Brits. The feeling is that the Rosetta Stone, Elgin Marbles, and other relics of ancient civilizations belong in a \"universal museum\" where, the argument goes, they can be viewed by millions and in the context of multiple cultures. A museum like the British Museum. The Elgin Marbles have been in London since 1802, and there they shall stay. End of discussion.\n\nWaxman is not deaf to the arguments of those now in possession of looted artifacts. She notes, for example, that for now many precious objects are probably better off where they are, since the country of origin may be unable to properly display, preserve, and secure them. A case in point is the 363-piece Lydian Hoard, looted treasure that the Met bought and actually hid. After years of stonewalling, the Met agreed to return the works, but only after it seemed that Turkey would prevail in Manhattan federal court. After repatriation to a small and poorly secured museum, the centerpiece of the hoard  a delicate gold brooch in the form of a winged horse  was stolen and replaced in its flimsy display case by a counterfeit.\n\nThe man accused of the theft? The director of the little-visited museum. Indeed, so starved was the museum for funds that the lone security guard doubled as a ticket taker and, until the theft, had no alarm system or working security cameras.\n\nWhat should be done? Waxman, who holds a master's degree in Middle East studies from Oxford, makes it clear that when it comes to repatriation there are no easy answers, \"no clear right and wrong as there was in the case of looted Nazi art.\" But she does offer several suggestions.\n\nFor starters, museums should be more candid in their catalogs, on their Web sites, and in display cards about the provenance  or lack thereof  of antiquities in their collections. They should own up to past misdeeds. Apologies should be offered. By the same token, source countries should accept that some demands may be premature, given their inability to preserve and secure the objects they seek.\n\nAs for the road forward, Waxman says it should be one of collaboration between source countries and wealthy nations that have the means and skills to preserve the patrimony of the former  at least for now.\n\nSharon Waxman, a former reporter for the New York Times, examines the tricky issue of antiquity acquisition and repatriation and, in the process, indicts some of the world's greatest museums for their willful and ongoing deceit about the provenance of many of the ancient works of art in their collections....",

The report, Ending the Drug Wars: Report of the LSE Expert Group on the Economics of Drug Policy (84 pages, PDF), highlights two approaches to collaboratively improving global drug policies: reallocating resources from counterproductive and damaging drug control regimes toward proven public health policies, and pursuing rigorously monitored policy and regulatory experimentation. Given that public health services for drug users have yielded substantial cost savings and positive outcomes, the report argues, governments should work to scale such programs and ensure that law enforcement does not block access to them. In addition to noting the importance of allowing jurisdictions to pursue regulatory experimentation, the report outlines a number of principles that can form the basis for local states thinking about cannabis regulation.",

Based on an analysis of the fifty largest INGOs in the United States that receive government funding, the report, Ahead of the Curve: Insights for the International NGO of the Future(58 pages, PDF), found that many INGOs still view the private sector as a source of philanthropic funding instead of as a partner that can help them scale impact. To avoid that trap, the report argues that INGOs need to focus on enhancing the implementation of their interventions by leveraging technology and data; shift from a project-based approach to more of a systems-change approach; harness the private sector's ability to create jobs, solutions, and prosperity; and forge multisectoral partnerships with a common agenda and shared impact measures. The report's authors also call on donors to support both local organizations well positioned to tackle implementation challenges and INGOs with the resources to champion new approaches; fund field resources to accelerate organizational strengthening; and invest in and facilitate sustained collaborations.",

        "title":"The Tyranny of Experts: Economists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the Poor",
        "content":"The Tyranny of Experts: Economists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the Poor by William Easterly, director of the Development Research Institute at New York University, opens with an indictment of the development community: \"The conventional approach to economic development, to making poor countries rich, is based on a technocratic illusion: the belief that poverty is a purely technical problem amenable to such technical solutions as fertilizers, antibiotics, or nutritional supplements.\"\n\nAccording to Easterly, \"The technocratic illusion is that poverty results from a shortage of expertise, whereas poverty is really about a shortage of rights\"  an odd claim to make in 2014, given the recent focus by nongovernmental organizations, multilateral agencies, and donor governments on the rights of women and girls, small and medium-sized businesses, and stakeholder engagement in development efforts.\n\nFor Easterly, in contrast, \"The sleight of hand that focuses attention on technical solutions while covering up violations of the rights of real people is the moral tragedy of development today....Morally neutral approaches to poverty do not exist. Any approach to development will either respect the rights of the poor or it will violate them. One cannot avoid this moral choice by appealing to nonideological evidence-based policies....\"\n\nTo support his thesis, Easterly structures The Tyranny of Experts as a sort of \"debate\" between proponents of so-called \"authoritarian\" development and \"free\" development, with sections titled \"The Blank Slate Versus Learning From History,\" \"Nations Versus Individuals,\" and \"Conscious Design Versus Spontaneous Solutions.\" At times, however, the book comes across less like a debate than a rambling jeremiad about the futility of applying one-size-fits-all technocratic approaches in underdeveloped countries. Indeed, the curious reader will soon find him- or herself wondering why the authoritarian development model that Easterly is so dismissive of was adopted by the development community decades before President Harry Truman announced the first U.S. foreign aid program in 1949. The answer, for Easterly, is self-evident: \"[B]ecause it offered power and a rationalization of that power to...the Great Powers, the humanitarians in rich countries, and political leaders in poor countries.\"\n\nCiting everything from the Treaty of Versailles negotiations, to the life stories of now-forgotten economists, to official reports and unofficial remarks, Easterly details how a technocratic approach to development enabled the victorious Allies \"to justify or excuse racist, colonialist, or imperialist policies\" by presenting themselves in the guise of the \"benevolent autocrat, using [their] superior technology to better the welfare of colonial subjects.\" State-led technocratic development also provided a young Sun-Yat-sen with a plan to strengthen the Chinese economy and resist Western imperialism, while various African leaders used it as a way to legitimate their nations demands for independence and justify their unchecked power. Similarly, by limiting their funding to research on \"facts and solutions\" with the goal of providing \"material benefits,\" private institutions like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York were able to avoid charges of political favoritism and interference.\n\nBut while Easterlys description of how the paternalistic development model was born of a marriage of political convenience between the public and private sectors rings true, it doesnt much advance his argument that poverty is about rights, or a shortage thereof. For that, Easterly presents a hodgepodge of anecdotal historical evidence to argue that open, legal-based systems with checks and balances on government power  the kind of systems that tend to foster respect for individuals and individual rights  almost always prosper, while closed, autocratic systems  which tend to perpetuate collectivist values  do not. All of which leads him to suggest that long-term democratic capital is the most relevant variable for economic development. (He does not buy former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yews argument that collectivist \"Asian values\" produced that countrys economic miracle, for the simple reason that, according to Easterly, there was no miracle: East Asias per capita GDP, which had been on par with Europes in 1500, had fallen far behind by 1960.)\n\nUnfortunately, the anecdotes Easterly has chosen often muddle his argument as much as they illuminate it. For example, in noting that Great Britain and the Netherlands prospered from trade with their New World colonies, becoming more oriented to individual rights as their respective trading classes grew in wealth and power, he doesnt fully address the role of slavery as a lynchpin of that trade. He also details the economic and social evolution of a single New York City block from a \"half-free\" slaves farm, to a red-light district, to a Depression-era shantytown, to a focal point of the Greenwich Village-based preservationist movement led by activist Jane Jacobs. Yet the ironic conclusion to Easterlys tale is that the block now houses high-end boutiques and $2.7 million co-op apartments  a strange choice to illustrate the superior value of \"free\" as opposed to \"authoritarian\" development.\n\nAnother flaw in the technocratic approach, Easterly argues, is its reliance on frequently unreliable, short-term data. As an example, he points to recent improvements in child mortality rates in Ethiopia touted by Bill Gates and Tony Blair. But Gates emphasis on \"setting clear goals, choosing an approach, measuring results and then using those measurement to continually refine our approach\" is meaningless, writes Easterly, if government data allow for wide margins of error, as they do in this case. (Never mind that Gates himself has acknowledged the difficulty of using data to improve the delivery of effective interventions.) Economic data has its own problems, and Easterly notes that the inherent unreliability of GDP-related data \"has received suspiciously little attention from those prone to worship national growth rates  that is, national policy makers and the experts and aid agencies set up to advise them.\"\n\nOne partial solution to the problem, he argues, is to use only long-term data. But such data invariably show that countries dont matter, regions do. Indeed, a 1991 paper he co-authored with future Treasury secretary Larry Summers and \"development superstars\" Michael Kremer and Lant Pritchett \"established just how little national policies actually do affect growth.\" And a series of papers published by others in the years since have shown that \"most instances of economic reform do not produce growth accelerations.\" Nor does rule by autocrat matter; the temporary growth seen under some can be attributed to the economic volatility inherent in poor countries, which in many cases just happen to be ruled by autocrats. In fact, long-term historical data show that \"[t]he growth advantage is with democrats.\"\n\nOf course, the biggest problem with insisting that bottom-up solutions fostered by the long-term accumulation of democratic capital is the only effective way to reduce poverty is that it stops short of offering concrete suggestions for development model reforms. \"We must not let caring about material suffering of the poor change the subject from caring about the rights of the poor,\" Easterly writes  a statement few, if any, would dispute. But his subsequent arguments about what we should do never quite cohere. Even his thesis that the real cause of poverty is the absence of political and economic systems that create opportunity for all is diffuse. Meandering anecdotes, section headings such as \"Another Key Moment in This Book,\" and generalizations about \"[t]he disrespect for poor people shown by agencies such as the World Bank and the Gates Foundation, with their stereotypes of wise technocrats from the West and the helpless victims from the Rest\" dont help the cause. As thought-provoking as some of Easterlys analyses are, many readers on finishing the book are likely to be left thinking it might have benefited from a little top-down organization.\n\nThedirector of the NYU Development Research Institute argues that the conventional approach to development is based on the erroneous assumption that poverty results from a shortage of expertise, whereas it's really about a shortage of rights....",

Based on a survey of more than nine hundred undocumented undergraduates in thirty-four states, the report, In the Shadows of the Ivory Tower: Undocumented Undergraduates and the Liminal State of Immigration Reform (40 pages, PDF), found that survey respondents had lived in the U.S. for 14.8 years on average; that 61.3 percent lived in a household with an annual income below $30,000; that 67.6 percent belonged to the first in their families to attend college; and that the most popular majors, accounting for 28.2 percent of the total, were in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. The survey also found that while nearly two-thirds (65.9 percent) of respondents had applied for and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, more than three-quarters were worried about being detained or deported and 56.7 percent reported being extremely concerned about financing their college education. Funded by the Ford Foundation, the report calls on policy makers to review federal and state financial aid policies; on colleges and universities to support outreach and retention efforts, legal clinics, and mental health services for undocumented students; and on funders to support scholarships as well as research on effective programs and practices.",

This alternative index, the chained consumer price index (CCPI-U), shows an annual rate of inflation that averages approximately 0.3 percentage points less than the consumer price index (CPI-W) that is currently used to index benefits. While this change would lead to $122 billion in savings to the government over the next decade, it also means that beneficiaries would receive lower benefits.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Since the vast majority of retirees rely on Social Security for the bulk of their retirement income, this cut in the cost of living adjustment would imply a substantial reduction in the standard of living of retirees, unless they offset it by saving more during their working years or retiring later in life. While we cannot know for sure how workers in future years will adjust their behavior, this paper assesses their past response to changes in the cost of living adjustment.

The Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey of 2012 finds that the reform law has significantly increased health insurance coverage of young adults. But the findings also underscore why it is critical that implementation continue on schedule. Nearly half (46%) of adults ages 19 to 64, or an estimated 84 million people, did not have insurance for the full year or were underinsured and unprotected from high out-of-pocket costs. Two of five (41%) adults, or 75 million people, reported they had problems paying their medical bills or were paying off medical debt. And more than two of five (43%), or 80 million people, reported cost-related problems getting needed health care.",

        "content":"Many think of leadership transition in government as something that happens only once every four or eight years. While presidential transitions are undoubtedly the largest in scope, leadership transition in government is a constant process. In fact, the average tenure of Senate-confirmed appointees is only 3.3 years, while appointees at executive departments generally spend only 2.8 years in a single post.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In a federal government made up of departments and agencies as large and complex as any Fortune 500 company, a strong leadership team is critical to effective governance. Members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) serve as the primary link between political appointees and the broader federal workforce, operating and overseeing nearly every government activity. They play a significant role during leadership transitions, ensuring the continuity of operations within government. Members of the SES are also uniquely positioned to help incoming political leaders build on the positive reforms of the past, and provide insight from lessons learned that can inform success in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The National Academy saw the 2008 Presidential transition as an opportunity to draw upon the experience of the SES to find ways to strengthen the partnerships between political and career leaders and build a more efficient and effective government. The results of our study reinforced the critical role played by members of the SES, and revealed that the majority of these career leaders, though experienced in government, were relatively new to managing transition issues as executives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The findings demonstrated that despite the newness of presidential transitions for most SES, they have a clear understanding about the role they must play in assisting new political appointees, the importance of forming an effective partnership, and their role in the process. At the same time, they wanted help to prepare for those roles, and were eager to engage in training and other activities that would promote success. These SES preferred to receive assistance in preparing for the transition through: (1) policy briefings; (2) discussions with their peers; (3) written materials; and (4) attendance at seminars or training sessions.",

Despite the scale and scope of this development, however, official data to portray it have long been lacking. This report takes an important step toward remedying this situation by presenting a summary of new findings from the implementation b statistical offices in sixteen countries of the United Nations &quot;Handbook on Nonprofit Institutions in the System of National Accounts&quot;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  Developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies in cooperation with the UN Statistics Division and an International Technical Experts Group, and issued by the U.N. in 2003, this Handbook calls on national statistical offices to produce regular &quot;satellite accounts&quot; on nonprofit institutions and volunteering for the first time, and provides detailed guidance on how to do so. The result is a far more complete official picture of the scope and structure of the nonprofit or civil societ sector than has ever been available in these countries. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This report presents the findings from the implementation of this UN NPI Handbook in 16 countries aound the world, including data on the comparative workforce, contribution to GDP, expenditures, revenues, and distribution of activities, and an in-depth look at the advantages off the Handbook approach over the traditional SNA methods of measurement.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  It is our hope that this report will help to encourage civil society and foundation leaders, volunteer promotion organizations, and statistical offices in other countries to promote the implementation of the UN NPI Handbook in their countries. The result will be to make the nonprofit and volunteer sector more visible, enhance its credibility, enable more effective partnerships between NPIs and public and private institutions, open new research opportunities for scholars, improve the clarity with which national accounts statistics portray national economies, and ultimately to improve citizen well-being.",

In doing such an evaluation, we believe the Coalition's work will be able to contribute to future advocacy efforts and cross-sectoral campaigns for issues of social justice. The CADIC Coalition's remit, on the rights of families comprised of Irish children, their migrant parents and other close family members, has meant concentrated efforts towards win-able propositions, and their impact, and it has harnessed the unique, collective expertise, commitment and passion of a diverse group of individuals and organisations. National, regional and local NGOs, spanning human rights, legal aid, children's rights, faith-based migrant support and other migrant and immigrant support organisations came together and brought pressure on Government and State agencies to review their policies and to uphold the rights of these children and their families.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As part of the evaluation of CADIC, the Coalition sought to learn about good practice in coalition building in Ireland. A process was agreed to abstract learning from the review feedback and to generalise this learning to provide a lessons-learnt document for coalition-building in Ireland. This document presents learning acquired during the CADIC review as a practical and straightforward guide to enable coalitions or those individuals and organisations that are considering building a national coalition in Ireland become more effective. This CADIC coalition-building learning document makes a number of key observations about the characteristics of a national coalition; the reasons for building a national coalition; what is useful about building and operating as a national coalition; and what are the pitfalls to be avoided when building a national coalition.",

The evaluation reveals that public libraries can be a resource for youth in low-income communities. In addition to providing access to technology and a &quot;safe&quot; place to be during out-of-school hours, evaluation results indicate libraries can provide high-quality youth employment programs that include training in both specific job skills and more general personal and social skills. These programs also can have positive impacts on the library system and the community. However, to work intensively with youth requires time, financial resources, dedicated staff, consistent leadership, and alignment of youth program with library's core mission and goals. Thus, public libraries need to assess and build their capacity for youth programs and services in a systematic way.",

The heavy emphasis on aid and debt relief made Western actions appear to be chiefly responsible for poverty alleviation in Africa. In reality, the main obstacles to economic growth in Africa rest with Africa's policies and institutions, such as onerous business regulations and weak protection of property rights. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Africa remains the poorest and least economically free region on earth. The West should do all it can to help Africa integrate with the rest of the world. It should eliminate remaining restrictions on African exports and end Western farm subsidies. Africans, however, will have to make most of the changes needed to tackle African poverty.",

This section takes up the question of the LTU as an enclave administrative reform versus semi-autonomous revenue agencies and &quot;whole of government&quot; reform involving broad based wages, human resources planning and anti-corruption measures.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Part II examines the emergence of the LTU and its relationships to the remainder of the tax administration system in different kinds of developing and transition economies, such as (i)capable developing states, (ii) administratively weak but governance improving states, and (iii)captured states. The relative success of LTUs can improve our understanding of the enclave approach to governance reforms as well as yielding insights that are intrinsic to the challenge of improving revenue mobilization. LTUs and their roles in developing country economies can also be interpreted through the prism of recent revisionist writings on best policies for the tax mix in the presence of a major informal sector and a government sector with a highly constrained taxing capacity and high vulnerability to corruption.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Working Paper Number 04-44.",

The objective of the report is to stimulate further reflection and exchange of lessons and opportunities for inculcating practices in philanthropy for supporting arts and culture work as a means to advance social justice and peace.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  The process of compiling this report has been a journey and, like all journeys, it has involved changes of perspective and, like some journeys, a revision of ideas. During its course, it has become clear to us that arts and culture are not just a matter of better tools for supporting change; they are often central to personal and social transformation. The arts often reach us -- and influence us - in ways that direct explanation cannot. The call to philanthropy that seeks to support progressive social change is to recognise this transformational power of arts and culture and to engage with it as a holistic strategy.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  This argument will be presented more extensively in a brief paper (to be published in August 2014) entitled, 'Making the Case for the Arts to Social Justice Funders'.",

        "content":"This paper focuses on the ways in which women in the United States are impacted by the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (usually referred to as ACA or 'Obamacare'). The ACA's three main goals of expanding access, increasing consumer protections and reducing costs while increasing quality of services will improve coverage, access to services and types of services that benefit women (and men). However, universal coverage remains illusive due to employer-based insurance coverage that allows firms to make decisions about coverage type. This patchwork universalism is the result of political decisions to extend rather than transform the current health-care system and as such reproduces many of the previously existing problems of uneven costs and coverage. The paper argues the ACA is consistent with other sets of US social welfare and labour market regimes that stratify access to social protections by income, race/ethnicity and gender as well as provide individual states with administrative and policy authority. The paper concludes that the passage of ACA will vastly improve health-care coverage in the United States, however, will continue to leave millions of people uninsured.
